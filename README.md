# Contrastive-Summarization-Tool

This is a contrastive summarization tool developed for Amazon product reviews. It aims to help buyers quickly find a product's advantages and disadvantages and decide whether to buy a product or not.
_____________________________________________________

**Project Scope:**

* Using BERT as a sentiment analysis model to classify Amazon raw product reviews into positive and negative clusters.
* Creating contrastive summarizations with the help of PEGASUS.
* Using BERT-based SUM-QE to evaluate the quality of the generated summarizations.

## Deliverables

- `BERT model` folder includes the BERT model for sentence classification. You should unzip all the files together.
- `Contrastive_Summarization_Tool` is the final notebook. You can input Amazon product reviews there and see summarization.
- `Summarization tool development notebook` is the notebook during the development.
- `Transformer-based Contrastive Summarization Tool on Amazon Product Reviews` is the final paper for this work.
