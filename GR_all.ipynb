              "'greatest mp3 that i have had!! otherwise this is an awesome player, all my friends go crazy over it it when they see it. it is a definite buy if your looking for something better than an ipod. also the music quality is awesome, i havent heard a single crack in th music, but for better quality you should get new earphones the ones the give are not that great sony has very good ones. i love my player i got my zen about 6 months ago and i have only had one problem with it. zen vision m - has it all and i mean all this little unit will not let you down. a powerful 30 gb can hold what you need...pay a little extra than you would for its \"cousins,\" you will be very pleased! the sound quality is amazing. once you toy with the setup (initially it is a little difficult) and figure out all the bells and whistles you come to the conclusion that the zen vision m is a superstar among the players! it truley is a vision to see and have this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned. this player is very touch sensitive but responds like clock work. very easy to use and it now comes in 60 gigs. the software that comes with it is actually easier to use than using windows media player 10 or others. i have video clips to music videos on it and the picture is crystal clear. overall i think its a good alternetive to the ipod if your looking for a good mp3 player with quality and quantity. versatile, great 30 gb storage my husband has the ipod. i am so glad i got the creative zen. - thinner, more elegant appearance - more cool accesories like covers, docks, cases, etc. - voice recorder\\'s awesome! and microphone - fm tuner - almost any format if music or video file, very flexible!!! - huge 30gb hard-drive can really be used as a flash drive!!! creative zen does the job. using my usb cable, i am able to bring files back and forth from work on it. it\\'s a little thicker than my husband\\'s 30gb ipod, but it feels more comfortable in my hand. such a great piece this player is extremely nice. the screen is bright, colorful, and sharp. although a small screen i become focused on it that it doesn\\'t matter the size. and it supports alot of video formats. comes with some nice headphones. i rarely need to change these settings. the smart volume is a nice feature too. not only is there software that will redo the mp3 tags but there is an organizer. the drag and drop feature is handy as you can create new folders and add to them. selecting random on 4000+ songs is excellent. a plus to this is that it plays wma which i feel have better sound quality when compared to a mp3 at the same bit-rate. for example, i love the fact that i can set my pictures as my background, and that i can use other color effects on them such as black and white or sepia. very neat. and i also really like that i can record songs and listen to them whenever. to sum this all up: this mp3 is definitley worth considering when shopping. its as good as everyone says it. its as good as the reviews comments and anything else positive you may have heard. amazing product! great product!!!! i\\'ve had my vision m since august and i couldnt be any happier. i was thrilled to find the creative zen, and even more thrilled when i found out it came in pink, you could play videos, music, came w/ ac adapter, fm radio ect.ect. amazing battery lifei would reccomend this to anyone!!! simply the best roses are are and some other flowers are blue, the creative zen vision is simply one of the best player in the market. pro: fm radio, out of the box (shame on ipod) + mp3 + wma (shame on ipod) + wav (shame on ipod) + video (not just mpeg/mpg, but a whole array of format) (shame on ipod) + records live radio (shame on ipod) + voice recorder, with no additional accessory (shame on ipod) + pictures + organizer + date + calender + multiple computer synchronization (shame on ipod) + functions as a full featured hard drive + great sound + subscribe to any music service (not just itunes) all in that small box. the creative zen vision:m 30 gb mp3 and video player represent a landmark in portable appliance design.people still buy the apple ipod just because it is the laziest, easiest choice to make.contrary to what you might have heard or read, creative zen vision:m 30 gb mp3 and video player is not at all heavy. but at the end of the day, this little we know; creative did a very good job with the zen vision. this is the real ipod killer. not for the ipod dreamers i purchased the zen a few weeks ago and i absolutely love it - almost. the video resolution is a little better on the zen (but honestly you want notice a difference unless you put them next to each other) and unless you\\'re playing with encodings and equalizer settings, the sound quality is superb on both. the click wheel on the ipod is cool, but there\\'s little difference in how you navigate - forward, back, play artist, big deal - to each their own, they both navigate and play easily. i chose the zen for the flexibility of file and media transfer, i extremely dislike media player and itunes for music management and file transfer. the zen allows me to transfer music\\\\video any way i want to (drag n drop in windows explorer), unless i need to convert a video file. the zen also doubles as a flash drive - without playing with the internal settings like all the literature tells you (ssshhh i didn\\'t tell you that). the fm tuner is a plus for me for traffic updates and the occasional trip where i don\\'t like a thing on my device - and if i like something on the radio, like a comedian or game, i can record it and listen to it later. creative zen vision:m i got one of these for christmas. im glad that i did cause this thing has more features that i like than the ipod does and its like the ipod has a delay everytime you switch songs and what not. the only thing about it, its real thick but that aint a big deal to me. everything about it is great. to be fair, before trashing this manufacturer completely, i purchased a 60 gig creative zen vision m a few months ago and was/am very pleased. easy to use, great picture quality, and have raved about it. she seems happy. it\\'s the most wonderful present i ever got, next to her and my children. thus, on my birthday i opened up the box to find a beautiful lime green creative zen vision m instead of an ipod and i couldn\\'t be happier. in buying my present, my wife got a better price, a better brand, a better product and a much happier husband. awsome, beats an ipod any day i just recently recieved this player in the mail and it is great. it is also more durable than my old ipod. the screen resolution is twice of what the ipod can display, and 4 times the color. overall i am happy with it. i don\\'t have any unintended software popping up because the zen software was installed. loading music , pictures and videos is simple enough and it\\'s easy to control which files do and don\\'t get loaded. great unit i originally purchased the ipod video 30 gig, and it had pathetic battery life regarding video, i then found the zen and this product punishes any competition, i can watch 2 hours of video while screwing around at work of course, and still use the the mp3 player all day on one charge. it also accepts all formats of video files so you dont have to re rip all your crap to mp4, plus it syncs with windows media player very easily. amazing mp3 player! i am still awed by the crystal clear resolution of the screen and the smooth playback of videos. i\\'ve always liked creative\\'s sound and the zen doesn\\'t disappoint. the player is easy to navigate as well; though there are many menus to go through, that just shows that the player gives you many options to work with. not to mention the vision includes an fm tuner and a microphone recorder as well. they work great for all my mp3 players. i\\'ve had the muvo2, ipod mini, the zen micro, and the iaudio x5, but the zen vision:m is the best buy at the $250 i paid for it. this player exceeded my expectations. crown the ipod killer as a headphone/indie rock/general snob, there was nothing i wanted less than an ipod, i might as well get a volkswagon, a powerbook and a seat at starbucks... the zen vision is incredible, the screen is so bright, navigation is easy, but could be better, and it plays all video not just mp4 (conversion sucks, asks anyone who has to render video)...it has a contact list, calendar, battery life is ground, the sound is wonderful...my only criticism is that you need to throw the creative headphones in the garbage and get some shure\\'s, grado, or koss portapros (at $50, the best headphones for the price in teh world)... in short - easy to use, easy to navigate, great features, great price, looks good, amazing screen... one of the best purchases this thing is awesome. it plays mp3s very well and also video. i\\'ve thrown different types of video and it plays it very nicely. the radio is a great feature and a better feature is being able to record it. also, it has a longer battery life, which is great for me considering the situation i\\'m in, so i decided to try it. the video quality is great! also, it doesn\\'t need special software to be able to convert most video/movie files, unlike the ipod, which you have to purchase at extra cost. great value & high functionality for the price this is for my 11 year daughter. she is ecstatic with it. the capacity is tremendous as well as the functionality. well thought-out player controls work well and seem logical after you learn the icons on the control pad. battery life is the best i\\'ve had. music sounds good, and radio gets good reception and sounds good also. pictures show up well on the large lcd screen. mp3 player with video playback..plus free shipping and $20 in free credit...what is not to like about this nice looking mp3 player! better than the ipod i have both and the creative zen vision m is simply the best. i have never had a problem with my creative and it even looks much better than the ipod, cooler i would say!!! the touch pad is better than the wheel (searching a song is easier). all the features (find a song, description of the track, bookmark, etc) are a huge plus. it works fantastically with wm11 so you don\\'t need the creative explorer. the fm radio is simply great and so is the record capability. it also supports more video files extension than the ipod (only mp4). this has been one of the best gadgets i have ever owned! i can listen to the radio on this thing and play movies/tech videos encoded in divx (which neither of the others could do). the video on the device is amazing! very good i bought this for my adult daughter for christams this yar. they lead me to buy the creative zen vision:m. she is very happy with it...so far. but we bought her a diffrent type and she is very happy. better than ipod the zvm is awesome! it has great battery life, awesome picture quality, it is easy to use, and can store a lot of music and photos. another great thing is that it has an fm radio and a voice recorder (you can record the radio too). awesome player, never froze on me yet, and it has great sound (creative specializes high quality speakers/sound) great device to buy. i\\'ve owned this for an year now, its a great device to own. great display, navigation, picture clarity, brightness. i use all the features, songs, pictures, movies, fm-radio, recording etc, simply works great. the sound quality is definitely better than an ipod. i do think they have the best on the market at the 30gb and higher. zen vision:m 30g a great mp3 + more i have owned my zvm for a few months and i\\'m very happy with it. i found the zen had more to offer for the price though. i\\'m particular about the sound quality and the zen is very good though you\\'ll have to buy your own earbuds or headphones. bass boost is great for extra punch though bass definition without it is already good. using my zen for pictures and movies is simple and i think the quality is good (even through my tv). the built in fm radio is great (though i wish the eq worked with it). the built mic and recorder worked great at a recent seminar(crystal clear). exquisite this mp3 player is amazing. the phenominal sound quality exceeds my expectations. the photo resoliution is pretty good. it fits in my pocket, the keys lock, it\\'s easy to use... helpful software. i chose this over an ipod and strongly support my descision :) enjoy! likes: out of the box this product looks great, very hard to scratch. the quality was great! dvd quality. the side buttons on the sides of the scroll, are very useful and intuitive. u can easily skip from songs, to letters and back. also you can customize your wallpaper, and delete songs, make playlists, etc on the zvm itself. mic is pretty good, picks up the voice very nicely. overall: - this is a great player. it looks amazing also. when i say \"the best\" it means the best literally. i have subscribed to rhapsody for few months and i love what they provide there. since i already had a very good opinion about zen , i right away bought the player and now i am very happy guy. i love it. the screen is just awesome. the user interface is much more pleasant than other players i checked out at the local stores. great sound. great videos. eventhough its a little bit thicker than the ipod i just like it that way. i use shure e2c with this player and i love the music without the rumblings bart. the sound is amazing, the controls are easy. first this player was the same price as the nano i wanted. also i loved the fact that this one had a microphone, recording capabilities and also the radio. so when it arrived i was not disappointed. i have never owned any other mp3 players so i am not going to compare, just tell you what i like about this one. i loved that fact that i felt like i was holding something and i didn\\'t feel as though it was going to snap it. the controls are easy to use and understand. (which i love as it hasn\\'t changed the look of the player.) i updated the diver from the creative web site and so far have had no problems. i was surprised how easy i found it to download all my cd collections and other things such as photos. the space is more than enough for me and unless you are a major music person i think it would be plenty enough for everyone. i have to say that the white earphones made me laugh and it is true that unless you stare you wouldn\\'t really know what you were using, apple or creative? i have found the earphones great but i am not a major music person and just want it to sound ok, which it does. i would recommend this to everyone i knew wanting one and especially while it is cheaper than the ipod. well, after reading almost unanimously favorable reviews for the zen here on amazon, i realized this was the player i\\'d been looking for - a high capacity unit featuring a wide range of compatibility with the three main forms of digital media, and hardly any glitches to boot. even the most sizable of mp3 collections can fit within reason on the zen\\'s generous 30gb internal hard drive. for those of us who take meticulous care in organizing our music just right, the zen accommodates these compulsions nicely by displaying the file\\'s title/album/artist info along with cover art...and who doesn\\'t love seeing that cover art? even the zen\\'s software is easy enough to use for managing playlists, and adding or removing files. better than ipod video in terms of both features and price! pros: - sleek design. very small. - beautiful screen, brilliant colors (more colors than ipod video). - you can customize wallpapers. - support for several video formats, including divx. - you can use wmp10/11 with it just fine so you don\\'t need to install creative software everytime you connect to a pc (this was an issue with older zen models). - shortcut button comes in quite handy. - better navigation than older zen models. - built-in eq, smart volume, and bass boost features. i did a lot of research, and finally settled on the creative zen vision:m. i was certainly impressed when it arrived, it is handsome and the player itself is easy to figure out, with gorgeous sample photos and videos to admire as i installed the software. i do believe the zvm will be fantastic when i get it to communicate with my computer, it has such great reviews. i\\'m loving this mp3 player! it is very easy to use & has great software to transfer files easily. i was also able to transfer music from windows media player very fast (it also worked with hp rhapsody). i can see why some complain that the touchpad is too sensitive, but it really isn\\'t bad once you play with it a bit, and if it really drives you nuts, there is a sensitivity setting - when i put it on low, it wasn\\'t bad at all! other reviewers have offered ample information regarding this, and i was pleased to find most found this to be the superior unit. -color choices -good price -plays more file formats -everyone and their dog doesn\\'t have one like ipod -holds alot -holds photos and video the cons -senative tap pad even on lowest setting -included softwear to convert files is useless and has yet to convert a file that wasn\\'t compatatable. the battery life is good,3-5hours on video. great player! in a market filled with ipods, this mp3 player is the only other one that i have heard of. it has created a niche for itself by providing a player with great storage, great navigation and user-friendly software and a wide variety of video playback. the ease of loading the player with what you want and creation of playlists and everything is much better than the ipod which i used to have before. thee battery is really good on par with the ipod and the screen with its brilliant display, easily surpasses the ipod. on the positive side it helps you keep your patience at clicking and loading or you\\'ll probably have to wait a whole day before you can use the player again. so folks great product, but a tiny, little bit slower software... the ipod definitely looks and feels better than the creative players. the features are better on the creative and the best feature is the dynamic building of a playlist on the creative player. this key and very important feature in my opinion gives the creative players a lot of flexibility, which is missing on the ipod. it started charging and now it\\'s working like a champ. this is a great player, the immediate impressions was a very tiring and difficult one but it then showed it\\'s true colours and boy was it beautiful. great product as a first time mp3 player owner i did extensive online reading prior to my decision. i purchased the zen vision m in january and it has proven to be an excellent decision. i have had no problems as mentioned by other reviewers, such as initial charging issues or difficulty with navigation. i also have not had the screen scratching problem complained about by many but don\\'t know if that is due to a superior than average zen or i am extra careful with its use. i ordered the ac adapter and car charger and they work great. pleasant player i\\'ll make this short and sweet - the zen vision: m is terrific! i\\'m techo challenged and resistent to newfangled gadgets but i enjoy this quality mp3 player. i appreciate the easy to use and gigantic screen design. i love the terrific sound quality. the digital photo display is fantastic. this is an overall outstanding mp3 player. i dislike the scroll wheel navigation especially. besides, the creative zen offers so much more. it\\'s clunkier looking than the sleek ipod nano and such but it packs a lot of good features. the botttom line is i really enjoy this fabulous player and think it\\'s currently the best deal. i love it! it was great when it worked hi. when my units were working, i loved them. they worked great. the software that the zen comes with is amazing and simple. songs, videos, and pics are an easy click & drag loading. album art is easy click and drag style, and you can browse through the zen by album cover, as if you were thumbing through real cd cases rather than just text. on the vision m, i love it, very solid piece, feels heavy and it feels like it will last as my prme player for a time to come. audio is solid, video looks great, i have tried to download dvd\\'s but keep running into conversion problems, but i am sure eventually i will figure it out. but, overall get this player, it is a great piece of equipment. while the features on the unit are appealing, and there is much more flexibility than with an ipod, in terms of file formats, etc., i doubt that i will ever purchase another product from creative. it is currently being worked on by creative labs and their service has been great (antoher reason it earned a 3). great customer service at creative labs. i love it. i look the look of the player because it does not look like everything else on the market it would seem. i gotta say the display is wonderful. great color! i never thought i could watch someting on a screen so small and enjoy it, but it\\'s actually kind of cool. the sound quality is very good as well. it comes with an equilizer option where you can customize it to your particular liking or set it to the common options of rock, jazz, classical, pop, etc., just like the ipod. sound is different in the car as opposed to a home receiver. i really like the dj option as well, since it will just play every song on my player randomly. i have not had any problems with the harddrive freezing or crashing. no hardware problems at all, especially since i did the firmware update. battery power seems fine since full charge probably lasts 10 hours or so. probably the coolest feature of the zen vision m is the shortcut button. that is pretty damn sweet if you ask me. so all in all, i definitely think this is a great option vs. the ipod. not to mention, the fact that i got the player, the neoprene skin (which absolutely rocks by the way), and the chargers all for less than the cost of a comparable ipod. i definitely recommend the zen vision m. with no comparable product from iriver this is the choice! this product is amazing. personally i like the product most because it requires no proprietary software to transfer data to the device. i have had it for about a year now, dropped it a few times on subway platforms... i dont baby it- and it has proved extremely rugged. if you want something rugged and functional, with very good sound quality get the zen! ----edit mar 08 - this thing is still clicking, ive dropped it on subway platforms, down stairs... etc etc... top notch! player is good until creative customer support comes into the picture. this is a great player for what it cost (at the time, $250). i have gotten far better service for far less expensive products. 4 1/2 stars - my 1st mp3 player (please amazon make it so we can rate with half stars.) i\\'ve had my zen for just under 2 years and i\\'m very pleased with it. pros: 1) it has always worked fine. 2) videos are amazingly clear. i bought a cable to use it with my tv and that works great too. 3) adding tracks and creating and managing playlists is easy. 4) i\\'ve never had any problems with the button system or touch pad. i love the shortcut button. 5) comes with an fm radio/recorder and a voice recorder. i don\\'t use either a lot, but it is nice to have them, and you don\\'t have to pay extra. 6) it is also nice to customize a background with pictures. 7) it comes with a pouch for carrying, that i use all the time. to me it feels sturdy. overall, i\\'m satisfied and glad i didn\\'t pay extra just for a \"name brand\". also, it\\'s nice not being chained to itunes. the company is still going strong many generations of devices later, and the zen vision m is frankly amazing. but the vision m has a 2.5 inch screen, and while that\\'s not going to push my plasma out of the way, it\\'s completely suitable for watching movies on planes and showing off pictures of the kids. the picture looks amazing - seriously, with plasma-like quality. the resolution and colors are realistic and vibrant. this brings up another great feature of the vision m: it isn\\'t stumped by proprietary media. where other devices require you to buy music specifically from them, in their format, the vision will play every type of music or video file i know. the interface is intuitive, although it might take awhile to find all the things the vision can do. the touch-bar in the center takes the place of the famous ipod \"wheel\", and it is just as fast. i like my ipod for its big memory, its interface and its battery life (even though its sound quality is a joke for a $350.00 mp3 player). the sound quality of sansa is better than my ipod, and the battery life is also longer, but the 2gb memory is way too small. the sound quality and battery life is better than my ipod, but it does not have fm recorder. and, yes, it is wonderful -- the sound quality, the fm radio, the voice and fm recording, the usb storage function, the drag-and-drop option (no need to be stuck with a certain program and computer, free to add music elsewhere without the only computer that contains your music library), the color and resolution of photos, the two-tone, pink-white body, the warmth (the metal of ipod is so cold in hand *_* ), the costumized wallpaper (you can choose your favorite picture or family photo as the background for the whole system, so you can always see it on the screen and change the photo whenever you want). but i am so sure that the sound quality of zen vision:m is way better than my ipod. but its screen color, its sound quality, its voice recording, its fm radio, its fm recording, its costumized wallpaper, its color choices (pink, blue, green, black, white), its solid and warmer feeling of the body -- all outweight my ipod classic. and works fine but it is a bit heavy for travel or on-the-go. i finally tried -- it works and it is very small and light-weight. great video player pro: great screen quality: i do not want to look at my friends ipods screen after using it for a few months. compatibility: plays almost all kind of videos out there. excellent player!! as good as the ipod... or even better! great player!! here is a resume of the pros and cons: pros: -great battery life -has radio, radio and voice recording capability -can use pictures as wallpaper -great screen -great support of video files -excellent sound quality -software is very easy to use and very stable -nice headphones... very similar to the ipods headphones cons: -much less accesories than the ipod -playlist not as easy to create as it is on the ipod -thicker than the ipod -horizontal touchpad can be a pain... although once you get used to it is very easy to use. revolutionary well i finally upgraded from my archos 20 recorder after 3 years of reliable use (it still works like a charm, but i wanted video). the sound is awesome, even with the headphones it came with. it sounds even better with a pair of shure e2c headphones. the scroll bar is super cool, the onscreen controls are pretty and intuitive. it syncs like a dream, plays almost all the video formats on the web (unlike ipod). i highly recommend it, it\\'s actually less than the video-ipod, has 10 times the features, plays 30 times more types of files, better screen, better battery life. awesome player i had first written a review, and my original enthusiasm still remains for this player. the player (after a firmware upgrade) still performs like a beauty. the player performs well, and i can squeeze off a movie, and 2 tv shows, roughly 2.5 hours of video, and still go on with about 6-7 hours of music (or possibly a few more shows). the player has survived coke and sprite spills, and there is no evidence of discoloration. it is very easy to hold, and is very sturdy. the buttons require a significant push, and the player feels like it is well built. sound quality is great. there is little lag in between menu options. the fm radio is of good quality, and features a little cell phone style bar that indicates signal strength. i usually have full bars, and the reception quality is crystal clear. the screen is gorgeous, and re-encoded tv shows and dvd movies still retain their quality. the codec is simple and most full-length movies will set you back 14-20 minutes. a good program is pocketdivx. divx however, was very stable. video out is good at the proper resolution, and looks like basic cable. still fun to use, but don\\'t expect hdtv. pros::: amazing feature set crystal clear fm radio good software for transfer gorgeous screen sturdy good sound/video quality cons::: freeze/desynch bug windows xp only! no drag and drop (not a biggie) scratch-fiesta in your pants pocket proprietary connections overall, i am very happy with the vision m. it performs well, and under good care, looks well too. the prices don\\'t seem to be different. first of all, i gota say this was the absolute best mp3 player in the world. the sound is amazing and the screeen, oh my gosh, it so freakin gorgoeus. i was amazed by creative for making this gift. finally an mp3 player that beats the ipod. let me tell you rite now it pretty much weighs the same as an ipod and it gives a sense of safety in yur hand. i relly like the controls with the options button relly helpin out and the bck button. to end this, this is a great and marvelous choice over the ipod or any mp3 player so a full thumbs up to buy this!!!!! awesome machine never regret. this is the best godget i have so far. amazing player with amazing capabilities just got mine 2 days ago. trasfering all my videos, photos, files was fast and easy. the screen is gorgeous. very vibrant and bright screen. the best thing with this though is the sound. zvm packs an impressive numbers of functions into a tight package. the sound is fantastic. the 2.5\" screen is gorgeous. photos look vibrant. otherwise, it does an amazing job with video playback. fm reception is strong. no problem filling 32 preset channels. the voice and fm recording provides really decent quality as well. the creative software is fine. you will be very happy with it. creative has designed and produced a truly amazing product that does an incredible job handling audio and video. sound quality is sparkling. the player comes with a basic set but they just don\\'t cut it in my opinion. check out the creative aurvana or other quality inner ear earphones. video playback is amazing. the screen size is generous and the colors and resolution are much better than i would\\'ve imagined from a portable player of this kind. some things to consider: i\\'m not crazy about the user interface but found that i have adapted. i purchased the leather case with the kickstand and screen protector that is available from amazon and have found that to be very good although i have to remove the player from the case to sync and charge as the cover prevents the unit from being plugged in securely. i would recommend this player to anyone that wants to have an awesome gadget that stands out from the masses of ipods out there. you won\\'t put this player down for weeks! great sound. the software is excellent (conversion, track name update per internet plus manual editing, complements windows media player, mp3, wav, wma, etc. ), the interface is easy to learn, records conversion for many hours on one charge, fm radio, calendar, video screen is crisp and bright. so far no complaints whatsoever. it has everything ipod has plus radio, recorder and an ability to be used as a usb hard drive. and it still costs less than ipod (creative is not obsessed with spending their every dollar on advertising). zvm works with pretty much any software. finally, the biggest star for zvm is you won\\'t feel like part of a herd on the subway. super simple to use... very easy to navigate. sound quality is excellent!! great product with a minor caveat so i don\\'t claim to be an expert in the world of hi-tech gadgetry, but i did use some rational thinking to end up choosing the creative zen as my portable mp3/video player. once you have the files on the player, using it is a breeze. the button controls are simple to get used to, and the interface is very straight forward. overall, im extremely pleased with my purchase. a friend of mine showed me his 30gb zen and i was really impressed especially with the video quality. if you want a versatile and very functional mp4 player try the zen - you won\\'t be sorry. great player for my son i bought the vision m player for my son about a year ago and the puppy is still going strong. 2) the battery life is better. 3) fm tuner. he likes to listen to the radio and record the songs 4) the screen seems a little sharper. other than that, the vision m has held up like a tank. on the positive side the music is very clear, it has absolutely great sound reproduction capabilities, the other major positive is that for $15 per month, you can sign up with yahoo\\'s rhapsody music service and in one months time, you can download thousands of songs to the vision m and all you have paid is $15. another really great feature is the fm radio. sometimes you just want to take a walk and listen to your favorite rock, jazz station or npr and this radio works really well. overall, i find it is better than the ipod i had which totally stopped working after about a year and a half and i would highly recommend it. perfect gift i just bought one for my brother in france. it is really cool! smart screen and amazing video quality. it delivers. i\\'ve had my zvm for several weeks now and i just love it. the display quality is outstanding, and it sounds wonderful. 30 gb is plenty of storage space for me. it is also very compact. better than the zen extra jukebox i am much happier with this player than i was with my 30 gb creative jukebox zen xtra. regardless of the color you pick, the zvm is the winning mp3 player hands down. by size ratio, i mean the usuable screen area is almost as wide as the player itself making for an incredible image size. also what stands out with the zvm is it\\'s array of features including fm. the font choice and clarity of the zvm will astound you only adding to the incredible video aspect. it is a pleasure to see as well as operate. compared to most players, it is about the same i must admit however syncs flawlessly with the incredible software provided. it\\'s intuitive, however not practical. despite these cons, the pros outweigh this product so much that i have no choice but to give it five stars. i love it....what more can i say i purchased my zen last week and it came the very next day. love it well, i wanted to be able to use media player for my mp3 player, as i had a smaller (1g) player that worked that way before i bought this one. and i found that with just a little use, this thing is about as self explanatory as windows for someone with just a little bit of tech knowledge. the creative zen vision m has got to be the best portable music device i have ever come across. its got amazing sound, video resolution and it looks amazing in person. its much easier to load music on the vision m than the ipod nano and its a lot of fun to use as well. but all in all its an amazing player and its worth every single dollar out of the 300 there are still plent of features in the machine that make it worthwhile, but it is important to note that if you have read other reviews before this one. video is actually pretty good, running close to 4 hours. if you are very anti-apple or are looking for a windows-based mp3 player, this is a great one. drag and drop is nice, and is a strong rival of the ipod until the zune hits the market next month! it\\'s great!!!! it\\'s more beautiful than i thought. the sound is great and the movie and the picture are so clear. the fm tuner is very good. i can listen to fm clearly. the sound is very great. moreover, the recorded sound is pretty good. great alternitive to apple if you\\'re looking for a different music player than the ipod, you really can\\'t go wrong with the vision. the storage size is nice for holding some of those shows on it. the size of the player isn\\'t that bad, though i fear somehow cracking the screen. it does a semi-decent job of being a flashlight(this was in a large transit tent). they were clean, strong and sounded like listening with a home system. zen vision - great choice i bought the zen vision m to replace my zen micro, and i\\'m so glad i did. the player feels very solid, and the large screen is easy to read. the color and graphics are outstanding. sync time is very fast. i liked many features of this player over the ipod, but the one that was most important was the fact that the vision plays .wma files (audiobooks). it handles them very well. sweet this zen is really awesome! very easy to navigate the menu buttons and control what your playing. its a good size so it feels sturdy but its very light so it doesn\\'t feel like a brick. the touch sensitivity takes some getting used to but you can set how sensative you want it, the buttons are perfect it all fits just right, no hand cramps! it comes with windows media player 11 which is some awesome software. it lets you write in different catagories and write in the info if your computer cant find it. the sound is great! i am not sure if its the player or the rip but the quality is great. sounded just under actual cd quality on my system....i was very happy. it has held up remarkably well being used nearly every day. the sound is remarkable. the software works well. the video is brilliant and sharp. my only reservations are as follows: the 30 gb fills up remarkably fast. he loves it. sound quality is great; ease of use is medium. downloading is easy. excellent value! also, if you are considering the advantages of this over the ipod what the reviewers here have said is true, you do get better battery life, a richer, larger display, the convenience of charging w/o a computer and faster with the included a/c adapter, more video formats supported and other features that you may or may not need such as radio, recording (both radio and voice), equalizer, etc. the zen vision feels well built and solid in your hand. anyway, i now have it working and it is a very cool device.....the screen is high-res and the easy way it works with amazon unbox makes me very happy.... i just wish my just-out-of-the-box experience was better....god only knows how mahny other people just sent it back... 1) the fm radio option was built in to the player, along with recording ability. 2)price was 15% cheaper then the ipod video. the quality of sound is superior. an outstanding product, better than the ipod video i\\'ve now owned 4 creative products....the very first jukebox, then then nomad jukebox 3, the zen sleek, and now this. i\\'m very very happy with the zen vision m. the video display is much brighter and crisper than the ipod video. sound quality is great. though i still believe the best mp3 sound i\\'ve ever heard came from the iriver, this one sounds very good. i use shure 4c earbuds to begin with, but the vision m sounds good even with less expensive headphones/earbuds. battery life is better than the ipod video. it\\'s not quite as good as my previous player, the zen sleek, but i\\'m also happy to see a good market for zen vision m accessories. fm tuner is nice, sound quality is good. this product is very slick and sophisticated. i\\'ve been using it heavily since i bought it in december, and am extremely happy with it. well, it does work, and has tons of features, including an fm radio and voice recorder. also, it works flawlessly with my urge subscription music service, including showing all the album art, it shows beautiful video, and the sound quality is excellent with my shure headphones. also, the battery life is excellent. i absolutely love it! with a 30gb hardrive, you never run out of room to store stuff. the screen looks like a hi-def tv, and the photo viewer is nice and user-friendly. plus it has tons of extras (fun to mess around with) like the voice recorder, fm radio, organizer, and tons more!! videos that you can purchase in the amazon video unbox thing go very nicely with the player. those work good too. the battery dosent keep a charge very long, but if you put in the lock position when listening to music and turn the screen brightness to 50 or 60%, that helps with battery life a lot. i highly reccomend this product. just like my previous zen,..the thought that goes into this product is amazing. wow, i appreciate that kind of user-friendly programming. plus,..i am \"reading\" a 1.2 gig audio book (truman, over 1000 pages) and the bookmark feature works great,..not to mention that the vision goes right to your last page when you restart it. there\\'s nothing better than drag and drop,..and the vision software is on the money. also, the battery life is excellent,..even better than the zen micro. they sound great, but i hate earbuds. i own the vision w and use the same charger but without the adapter required by the m. enjoy it looks great and i really like the interface. itunes is a great setup and makes it very easy to find podcasts. with the zen vision, i can sync up all the songs i have downloaded from either of these services as long as i am a subscriber. the zen also has other features which, to be fair, i don\\'t know if the ipod has or not. it can also sync to outlook, so i can keep my meeting schedule with me no matter where i am and show up to work on time :) i shouldn\\'t forget to mention that the sound and video quality are also really good. i was able to find a good number of protectors for it, and it is compatible with a lot of the ipod speaker/docking stations out there. but in the end, i had the choice between the two and the zen media player won. so much to like, so much to be annoyed... what a great mp3 player. > the aahhh so great: what a beautiful screen, outstanding sound quality, photo slideshows while you listen to music and the number of tweaks to the settings is almost endless. but the vision m is darn good and fun too! not the perfect mp3 / jpeg / video player... but getting close after a wholeheckofalot of research into my new mp3 player, i finally decided on this little beauty. easy to install (like a clear film, not just for the screen, but the entire front acryllic top. very nice and very effective) (2) the built in battery; c\\'mon creative! you can create and manage playlists at will on the computer. (2) custom 5-band eq setting; most manufacturers only give you preset eqs (3) volume levelling on all tracks. so, after only owning it one week, i absolutely love this thing. i think this thing is fantastic. well worth it this little device has become my new best friend. the music playback is excellent, it\\'s like hearing some of these songs for the first time as i now hear little things i hadn\\'t before. the video playback is fantastic, for such a small screen it really delivers beyond what i thought it would. i bought a kroos case and really like it. i could\\'t recommend this mp3 player any higher. it\\'s a good investment. in terms of hardware, the vision m could not get much better. its 5 stars all the way. good sound, fantastic picture quality, built in radio and so on. videos converted using divx 6.4 and its associated converter, work fine on this device. 2) the software (compared to itunes) is pretty lightweight. 2) direct usb connection. 4) a 4 way controller with a button in the middle 5) accessories - such as ir remote dock station, receiver dock - etc.. and reasonably priced. 7) compatibility with the most common music and video formats out there. 8) user replaceable batteries. 9) optical output (to connect to your home stereo) 10) 16:3 screen (most video is already moving to this format) very cool, but usb port problems alright, i guess i\\'ll be nice and give them a 2. when it worked, it was great. ui was pretty good, holds a whole lotta songs, pretty nice screen. i am extremely satisfied with amazon in this transaction. for what its worth: my son has a sansa and it seems rock solid. that being said, here are my pros and cons of the product when it worked: pros: + decent battery life + capable fm tuner - i personally got good reception with it. you can also record fm + videos display well on the screen. colors have good saturation and images are crisp + sound quality is good + 30 gb is more than enough space for music lovers + has a voice recorder function (although it takes a few steps to get to it) cons: - charging. and this is a player that touts that it can play almost any video file. this is a great product,(dont listen to apple fanboys) dont get me wrong, the ipod is a great product but i am sick of hearing apple fanboys rant on this player. the creative zen vision m does everything that the ipod does and way more. compare: vision displays nearly 4 times the number of colors of the ipod. the vision supports a wide variety of video formats that the ipod does not. if you want a quality product at a good price, definitely choose the zen vision: m. the screen...awesome. just awesome clarity and color. photos pop off the screen and nicely encoded movies look great. sound quality is quite good. i like the fact that there\\'s a radio and you can make one selection and have it go through and automatically program the stations that come in strong. voice recorder is a cool option too. it is ok, but i am not really happy with it 1) good things about it is that so far it plays all music files in any format and most of my video files. 2) the screen is very bright and colorful. better than i thought i just recently bought this player and i have to admit it is much better than i thought it would be. sound - way better than ipod (creative have more experience with sound than apple do) . battery - lasts twice as long as ipod (this is why it\\'s thicker than ipod). screen - resolution is four times higher than on ipod 5g. video formats - supports divx and xvid among others, unlike ipod where apple force you to use their stupid mpeg4 format. great player!!!! good partner with a media center pc just got one a month ago. ), this is a good device in that you can easily sync it with the mcpc and put your recorded tv shows on the player. then to get music you can just rip your cds or use a windows oriented digital music service like rhapsody or yahoo or whatever.... the device is handy, it\\'s cute, the sound and video are good. amazing mp3 player i did a lot of debating between the ipod and the creative vision: m before deciding on the creative. the player is gorgeous, feels solid, doesn\\'t have the stupid scratchable chrome to worry about, it has a very intuitive and simple to use interface, the sound quality is amazing, and what comes in the box is way better than the ipod (better headphones, a wall charger, good documentation). i\\'m very happy with my player, an alternative for those who don\\'t want to say baaaa when steve jobs touts the next big thing. greatest thing ever-this is for all you biased ipod junkies this player is amazing....all you ipod junkies need to break away from your little cult on ipods, and actually realize there is something better manufactured that an ipod, and thats a creative zen vision:m. my zen vision is amazing, its battery life is phenominal, and its screen blows me away. i\\'ve had the creative zen vision: m for about three months now, and i absolutely love it! here are the pros and cons of this great little device: pros: 1) beautiful screen - the screen has 262,000 colors, compared to i-pod\\'s 65,000 colors. there\\'s no ghosting (same can\\'t be said for my archos player), and scenes are smooth and crystal clear. 2) interface and controls - the interface is so intuitive! it\\'s so easy to locate everything. of all the electronic products i own, the interface on the zvm is the most intuitive and one of the best. i also love the controls. the shortcut button is also a very useful control feature. the controls also have mysterious sapphire blue led lights, which makes it easy to navigate in the dark not to mention the fact that it looks cool. 3) customization - with the zvm you can customize your background with your own wallpapers. 4) sound - sound quality is superb! 6) feature packed - the zvm is packed with features, and offers the most bang for your buck. the player has a radio, voice recorder, contacts and calendar features, hides folders/media that you don\\'t want anyone else to see (and that is unlockable with a password), plays all the popular video formats, and supports subscription music services like yahoo music and napster. 7) battery life - compared to a lot of other players i have had, battery life is exceptional! 8) price: you get more bang for your buck with the zvm, and the price is comparable and depending on where you shop, often times cheaper than the ipod. granted, the zvm is thicker than the i-pod, but the thickness does make it more ergonomic and comfortable to hold. however, the only accessories i need are a good leather case, silicon case, wired remote, and travel speakers, and all of those items are available for the zvm. a lot of the accessories out there for the i-pod are ridiculous and unnecessary anyway... all in all, i would highly recommend the zvm, it\\'s one of the best purchases i\\'ve made! i recommend the zvm for all those looking for a feature rich player with a great screen, intuitive interface and loads of customization options. the i-pod is also a good device, though i think its a bit overrated. i would recommend the i-pod to those looking for a simple music device with a nice design and simple interface, and who don\\'t mind being dependent on i-tunes. wonderful except for the touch pad after having done about 20 hours of internet research and then going to a vairety of electronic stores, i purchased the creative zen vision m (black) because of its features and sound clarity. this is my first mp3/multimedia device, and i am amazed with how easy it is to \"rip\" cd\\'s and video. i strongly recommend this one for beginners because its variety of features, including using it as a \"flash drive\". the video playback is as good as any newer computer monitor or the handheld tvs which have recently come on the market. it is much better than the portable play station. the touch pad aside, the battery life, the picture and sound quality, the voice recorder, the fm radio, the organizer, and the really easy way to load music and video make this a pretty good product. not a massacre, but gives the video ipod its 1st loss (albeit split decision) i bought this device a couple weeks ago and have been very happy with it. the video quality is very good - at 2.5 inches, you\\'d be hard pressed to find anything better. the breadth of formats available for video is spectacular. audio quality is very good, i would suggest that you purchase a decent pair of headphones to replace the buds included in the package - they are no more than sufficient. there is a great feature here that you don\\'t find elsewhere - one user customizable button which you can set to any function available from menus. the tactile buttons are very responsive and feel solid - a lot more useful than the kludgy pressure sensitive ones on prior creative players. the software for adding and removing files is pretty good - itunes is better, but it\\'s not a runaway. overall: great device, highly recommended if you don\\'t have to walk lock-step with the prevailing ipod masterdom. pros: beautiful video display. many video codecs supported! very good battery life. good button response. for: memory; multi-functional (radio); battery life; uses ms media player and you don\\'t need to load any of the provided creative software. this is my first mp3 video player, i\\'m frugal so never want to buy anything twice and try to get things that are ahead of the technology so they last longer. the better battery life for video also helped me in my choice of the creative zen vision mp3 30gb player. if you want a multifunctional device as i did, i recommend you buy the creative zen, it is a very good player. more better than the ipod video i love my zen vision m. its the better media player i ever had (it\\'s better than my ipod video). pros : the sound is excellent. the screen is amazing. the controls are easy to operate. very easy to transfer media archives and you can make play lists very fast. and this can support many more video formats than the ipod video. also the battery life is 2 times more durable then the ipod video. creative zen i\\'ve have my creative zen for two weeks now and i love it. the one thing i liked over all about it from the beginning was the fact that i didn\\'t have to pay extra to put music on my mp3 player, like you have to do with an ipod. with features that alowe all music shuffle, or you can select songs by playlists, genera, artist, or album (much like any standard player). it does show the photos nice and you can zoom in, since 2.5 inch screen is small already. 2.5 inch makes everything hard to see but it\\'s big enough to atleast enjoy it if you do use it. the fm tuner is cool and i would use that. if you want to listen to a sports game or something like that, it\\'s very handy. the battery life is decent. photos= can\\'t see anyone spending 9 hours looking at photos but it\\'s good for that too. it comes with all the cords and software you\\'ll need, except for the video cords, but it has an ac cord for charging in the wall. the nice carrying case doubles as a screen cleaner, but i left the screen protecter it came with on. you have good battery life and decent video playing ability. the fm tuner is good and so is viewing photos. it comes with the power cords and a nice carrying case. this player is the real deal. this player will amaze you. the display is excellent, the colors are very well defined especially for having a 2.5\" screen. the interface is pretty easy to learn - just remember two tricks, holding the back button takes you to the main menu and you can hold down the shortcut button to assign it to the menu of your choice (i chose the artist list). it supports a wide variety of video formats and if you use creative\\'s software to transfer them onto the player it will prompt you of all of the files that need to be converted and will let you convert them all at once (not many will need to be converted). perhaps the best thing about this player is not being an ipod it allows you your choice of music stores including wal-mart (88 cents each), buy.com (some 79 cents), napster, musicmatch, allofmp3.com, the list goes on - you aren\\'t stuck with itunes. got this product about a month ago, has been working flawlessly since. no errors or malfunctions, beyond occasional freezes on certain videos (which would be expected with the wide range of video codecs out there -- fault of the file not the device). the headphones that come with it work great, nice volume... and the video is probably my most favorite area of the player. being virtually unrestricted in what types of videos you put on the player (as opposed to the ipod) makes video transfers a lot easier, and the screen has bright, amazing colors. it\\'s like having a mini portable dvd player with me. very good purchase, and for the price, i would highly suggest it. overall, a good player player has worked well so far. battery life has been good. i absolutely love this product!!! my husband bought this player for me as a birthday gift and it\\'s the best!!! loading songs is a breeze, and windows media player even finds the album art for you. the color on the screen is incredible. though the documentation is a bit skimppy, once you play around with it for a while it\\'s easy to figure out and navigate through all the functions. i just figured out how to load full lenght movies on it through another company\\'s software (m2 convert for zen 29.99) and the movies look absolutely flawless. pictures load very easily as well and the fm tuner, organizer, and removable storage are a nice touch. other than that it is perfect. top-notch alternative to ipod if you\\'re an anti-ipoder like me, it\\'s quite a relief to find an alternative brand that either beats or equals the ipod in nearly every way. i\\'ve had it for about three weeks now and am incredibly satisfied. key points to consider, in comparison to an ipod: - the zen is sturdier and doesn\\'t scratch easily (compared to the silver back of an ipod/the black ipod). also, with the matte back and finish on the front, my player has absolutely no smudges. - it\\'s a little bigger, width-wise, than the ipod, but for me it helps me feel like i won\\'t break it. it\\'s the perfect size and weight, i think. - everyone was right: the colors you get on screen are amazing. sucks... but you can put any other video type on there), but if you don\\'t mind those small things (and really it\\'s a matter of preference), the zen is fabulous. best media player i\\'ve ever used this is quite simply the best media player i have used. it\\'s extremely user-friendly, has a long battery life, is extremely durable and plays many different file-types (unlike the apple i-pod). and it\\'s cheaper than an ipod people! get this product, it\\'s amazing and you\\'ll love it just as much as i do. firmware enables fm record - thanks creative!!!!! the fm record capability is back! it\\'s great. the silicone one is very nice. i am ecstatic that i now have the fm recording back and can now record shows. buy this mp3, you won\\'t be disappointed in the least! bookmark feature the creative zen vision-m has a bookmarking feature that works very well. so if you like to listen to audiobooks this is a real fine player. as the title indicates, this product is totally amazing. i finally got it 24 hours ago and it is just fantastic. if you want an excellent product, easy to use and synch, a 30gb external hd, an fm radio, excellent video player, and a voice recorder all in one, this is the product for you. the real ipod and zune killa.................. - option of an fm tuner - built in microphone - feels more sturdy than the ipod.. the comfort of knowing you have a grip on your mp3 player - works with windows media player - navigating thru the player is easy for windows users - plays almost all standard file formats inclusing wma and wmv all these spell a better product and it only tells us to expect better products from creative. it does not loose any save songs but it is anoying.besides that it is still better than both products. the toshiba gigabeat was nice, i liked the large screen, and the fact it was windows media player compatible, but it seems like there were more negative coments made about it than the zen vision, bad battery life, twitchy hard drive, dead units ect.... plus the zen just had more features in a comparable package and price. anyways i finally decided on the creative zen vision m and i am quite pleased to say the ow i figgin\\' love this little thing i can\\'t put it down! i just got it yesterday and i\\'m certainly impressed. great design, great file support, great sound, great features.great screen the only thing thats a little strange so far is i looked forever for a stop button, there isnt one you can pause or turn the unit off, but there isnt an actual stop button. the screen looks awesome while playing videos, i wouldn\\'t want to watch a three hour movie on something that small but its perfect for watching a short movie between classes or in the car ect... like many others i do wish there was a few more neat little devices availiable for it in stores (hint hint best buy, if your going to sell the player at least stock more than one skin/case for it and maybe at least one dock/speaker system as opposed to the 20 or so you sell for ipods, ok enough ranting) that is but you can get pretty much anything you need through creatives website or amazon, ebay whatever. anyways i would highly recomend this player to anybody! i love it! i have now purchased 3 mp3 players and this is by far my favorite! it has a much better battery life than the ipod and the software is way better. but the creative media source software is great! it\\'s super-user-friendly so i didn\\'t have to worry about ripping all her music for her. plus it\\'s fast enough that she wouldn\\'t get frustrated with it. the player itself is also pretty good even though it doesn\\'t have a lot of bells & whistles. it has excellent battery life, good sound quality, and is really easy to navigate. now, this creative zen vision i just received - is awesome! i love it! it\\'s got a bright, crisp, colorful screen, is fast, has wonderful sound quality, and does everything but wash the dishes. i\\'ve had it for almost a week now and haven\\'t tried out all the features yet - like the fm tuner, but i\\'m smitten. the software is a newer version of creative media source and i still like the software a lot. it quickly synced my new player with our existing library of 2600+ songs without a hitch! i highly recommend this product! my zen baby this is my first mp3 player so i don\\'t have anything to compare it to but i love it. the sound is unbelievable, the picture is gorgeous and the touchpad is exactly what i wanted. i would have preferred that method of sorting but when weighed against the incredible sound and ease of use, it\\'s a very small matter. i bought the custom skin to protect the screen and case and it couldn\\'t be better. it was easy to put on and while you have to press the buttons through it, it\\'s easy to do and the locations are clearly marked. and while i haven\\'t dropped it yet (fingers crossed), the rubber feels thick enough to provide some protection when i do. altogether, it\\'s been a realy pleasure to use and i totally recommend it. great product - while it works. otherwise, product support is awful i\\'ve had mine for almost a year now, and the good news is that, while it\\'s working, it\\'s great. i love this mp3 player! but the creative zen vision:m 30 gb mp3 and video player caught my eye when i was shopping for an ipod, and since it rated so highly in the tech reviews i decided to buy it. the creative does all that perfectly and i couldn\\'t be happier. i\\'m amazed at the crisp screen definition! another big plus for me is the length of time this little object of desire plays on a single charge, especially playing audio. i\\'ve never had to charge it in the car, it just plays and plays. the controls are easy to use and the bookmarking is very easy -- helpful to me when listening to books. i like having complete control over my library and itunes is great for ripping and renaming/id3 tag changing en masse but i hate hate hate using it for my nano (it was a gift!). 2) interface - i\\'ll give yah this one. creatives interface is pretty intuitive but the click wheel is a darn nice idea apple has. the battery life is the same as the ipod however, except with video (4 hours-ish for zen). 4) color variation - i\\'m pining for the green one. 5) ac - my buddy lugs his power adapter (30 bucks extra from good ol\\' apple) around for his ipod. 6) software - you don\\'t have to use any but yet again this is up to the consumer. 7) microphone - usable in class lectures. also people have actually said the sound quality from recording was good, instead of this person claiming it would be bad. i love this mp3 player i did a lot of research before i ended up buying the creative zen vision m. after my research it came between the iaudio and the zen vision m. i didn\\'t even consider the ipod video since these two players had better video quality play back then the ipod video. the audio is great, and video playback is great. what i love the most about it is that i can click and drag my video files into my zen vision m not having to convert it first. also, few people know this, but you don\\'t have to embed album art in a song\\'s track tag for the zen vision m. zen\\'s software allows you to drag and drop any picture file for a given album name. a great product for technophiles everywhere. creative hits the spot with multiple video format support but still no ogg vorbis format support for audio which according to recent conducted tests reigns in quality above all other formats and no support for free lossless audio formats like flac & wavpack which absolutely rule in the audiophile world. nevertheless,this product is the current king in its category,it simply ravishes apple\\'s ipod line with more features/more value,i wont supply more info on this,just read the reviews in various dap sites. this has a radio, microphone, longer battery life, more compatible formats for music and movies, and more. i have the pink one which i bought the second week of march and i love my mp3 player. i was way impressed and proud of him, lol. best portable multimedia player out there easy to sync with windows media player. large, bright, crystal clear screen. nice touch of displaying of album covers. easy navigation. everyone else has already covered the pros and cons so i just want to say that this is one of the best electronics on the market. thank you to creative for making this excellent device and amazon.com for overnighting it when i finally chose this over the 5th gen ipod. she has had no problems after 2 years of use. wonderful had the player for a few weeks and love it. it is extremely easy to use with a pc and accepts tons of file types. the screen is beautiful. in a zen-like place i purchased my zen on 2/9/06 and have been extremely pleased thus far. if i haven\\'t broken it in a year, i will concede the last star ;) good: + works flawlessly with subscription services. unlimited downloads for $15 per month beats other pay-per-song services hands down. + easy software interface, easy to rip, store, move, and create play lists from your media. + it seems very durable (i\\'ve dropped it once). + software interface structure is fairly configurable. visual quality is pretty good given the size of the screen. + excellent sound quality from the audio mini-jack. + sounds fabulous in my truck - i hooked it directly into my head unit by buying an ip bus cable (for my deck) and an rca to mini-jack cable. the result is awesome static free listening. in all, i am very happy i went this route and would recommend the product to anyone who is looking for this type of player. best mp3 player! video ipod killer best mp3 player on the market! -- the screen is just awesome, ipods screen looks washed out and its only 65k colors compared to the creative zen vision m 256k colors. -- the battery life is definitely better than the ipod. -- the creative definitely does not feel like cheap plastic, its really well built and solid! -- lets compare the video features creative video playback easily handles mpeg, divx, xvid, wmv9, and motion-jpeg. --light-up buttons -- organizer syncs with outlook > calendar, contact, task list on the go! an amazing video/mp3 player**** i\\'ve bought 2 of these babies. it is one incredible player!!! i love it. it is so easy to rip your cd\\'s to this player with the creative software that comes with it. it also plays video with amazingly clear resolution. even at the lowest video transfer the picture is still incredibly clear. i purchased the applesauce polish and refiner and it cleans up the scratches very well. all in all i\\'m extremely happy with this player and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a video/mp3 player. it also has a built in fm radio tuner, which works extremly well as well as voice recording and photo slideshow feature. it is simply amazing!!!! wonderful player, looks great setting up and charging the player was a breeze. the included software is quite manageable, but i actually prefer using the plugins that real has for their player to transfer files to the zen. its nice to have an option of software to transfer files to the player. for someone interested in an alternative to the omnipresent ipod, this is a great item. you can also blow people away buy playing your videos on this very vibrant screen. i\\'ve shown just the demos to people and they are amazed, watching a show on this tiny screen is not all that tough on the eyes because the picture is quite clear. personally, i still derive a little satisfaction from having an enjoyable player that doesn\\'t look like everyone else\\'s. surprise... high quality recordings!!!! needless to say, i played a few minutes worth of live piano music, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality of the recording was comparable to that of my md recorder, with which i use a high grade microphone. i do not regret my decision to go with the creative zen over the ipod... the zen actually looks a lot better in person than i thought. oh, and the screen is awesome, as the others have said. overall sound quality is wonderful. controls are easy to use. there is one soft key for which you can assign the function ... this i really like! so far, this has been a really good buy.... 9 out of 10 stars the ipod 5g is better for: button interface (slightly) firmware updates available car radio docks (more selection) the vision m is better for: everything else yes everything. new purchase i recently purchased one of these from best buy and so far so good. this is by far the best one i\\'ve had. the sound and eq controls are great. the software that comes with it is versatile. the display screen is great, big with vibrant color. even better and the reason\\'s i chose it over ipod, it has an fm tuner, voice recorder, organizer and most of all, it was compatible with my wma formatted music. all things considered though, ounce for ounce i think that it is the best mp3 that i\\'ve seen. happy with the zen i used to have an ipod but i wanted something with video capabilities, something my ipod couldn\\'t offer. this player came pretty highly recommended and, as far as i could tell, moreso than ipod video. having had the zen for about a month now, i think it would be fair to say that i\\'m largely happy with it. in terms of video, connecting the zen to your tv doubles the fun! playback quality is just fine and it\\'s really convenient to do it this way rather than burn a bunch of stupid svcd\\'s or dvd\\'s that i\\'ll only watch once or twice. i like it. i like the random play mode, its pretty good. zencast support seems to be good. quite easy to manage the playlists. its got a good feel to it and comes with a belt clip and (gym) arm band too. the videos are crisp even through the dlo. usability: i feel the interface could allow a few more customizations for the the other buttons, its not bad right now, just it could be better. fantastic device with all the features i wanted i spent a few weeks researching all the mp3 players on the market, reading many reviews and customer comments (amazon, c-net, etc.). though the apple 30 gb ipod was very compelling, and i am a huge apple fan and dedicated itunes user, i couldn\\'t be happier with my vision:m. it has met all my needs - the software is very easy to install, and easy to use. the unit is sturdy; i have traveled several times with it on business trips without any problems. with available software, i am able to convert any format audio or video to use on the unit. the fm tuner, voice recorder, and especially its ability to act as a hard drive to backup my laptop on the road are all added benefits at no additional cost, like with the ipod. i would strongly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a high capacity mp3 player. overall, i love this thing. it does support xvid and divx so at least there is the possibility that you can watch some of your videos without conversion - a possibility that does not exist for several other portable video players. i could list all the great things about the zen vision:m, but that\\'s what the enormous product description up above did already, so you don\\'t need me to tell you that it has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. i highly recommend it in spite of these minor nuissances. so before i bought an mp3 i decided instead of the ipod, i should try the creative zen vision m. i was so impressed with the quality of it. the video quality of the zen is better then the ipod, pretty much every single feature is better then the ipod. but the zen also has extra features that the ipod doesnt have such as radio, voice recorder, calender, organizer, contact lists, and my favorite feature of the zen is the choice of background. simply the best there is. i bought my first in june and it has done everything it says it does and to perfection. we use it everyday, it has never crashed or givin us any problems. it doesn\\'t matter where the music came from it loads and plays. we love it that\\'s why we just bought another. 5 stars screen viewing. 5 stars quality / durability. 5 stars battery life. you will fall in luv with this thing!! you can even play the music (which sound crysal clear and good volume) and leave it playing while u browse around all the menus looking at pic play slide show to the music and go right back to the now playing screen. the movie quality is the best iv ever seen. much brighter and more colorfull than the ipod video thing or the psp. it slightly cumbersum to fast forward and rewind music or movies but u get used to it easily enough.and it holds so much!! here are a few: it\\'s holds a lot, and the screen is great. it comes with lots of software, all of it easy to use; great products, themselves. (i have recently located a new, improved version that has a \"smooth\" texture and comes in black; hopefully this will undo the major \"con\" of this item.) creative/zen has won me over - i\\'m beyond loyal to this brand; they\\'re just about as good as it gets. excellent player with some issues by now you\\'ve probably heard how great this player is. excellent video, intuitive controls, great sound. if you get past this (really, it sounds harder than it actually is), the player itself is great. i use it daily and i wouldn\\'t trade it for any other mp3 player out right now. zen vision:m.: a great media player! the screen of the zen vision m looks like a high definition one. it is simply amazing. the sound it\\'s better, although that might be only because the creative earbuds are much better than apple\\'s. i dont hear any difference when playing through the audio outs in an an amplifier, but out of the headphone out i think the zen beats the ipod. the reception is very good and the recordings quality are amazing. the voice recorder is also great. the unit works like a standard usb drive, you dont need any software to move files back and forth from the unit. the video out is quite good, but i understand it could be better. something that i particulary missed about the video playback capabilities is the divx ultra, or the ability to display softcoded subtitles (one or several subtitles that can be turned on/off in one divx clip). you can also find freeware programs with ability to play lossless (flac, etc) in the zen vision m. after all the advantages i dont think the 1 sec. i am in love with the zen! but you can find most accessories for the zen too. cambridge soundworks has a docking similar to the bose one that suposedly delivers great sound. great player had this player for a few days. this is a great model. the screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy/clear. they really did a nice job with the touch pad this time. it has a great feel. it also works flawlessly with yahoo music unlimited. great scores everywhere! this thing has been getting awesome reviews, and was apparently no.9 in some magazine for coolest products of 2006 (a list of all things cool, not just daps). i recieved mine not to long ago and i love it. video quality is amazing and so is the sound quality. best mp3/video player out there!!! what i like: ~~it has great color display, more than the video ipod. ~~video quality looks excellent, even with small subtitles, you can see everything perfectly. ~~i like the fact that it actually plays mp3s, and not the proprietary formats that ipod converts to. (important because you can use your zen vision:m as a flash drive for importing and exporting videos, pictures, and mp3/wma) ~~it plays divx!!! and it also plays windows media video (wmv). ~~battery life on the zen vision:m is great. not much to say about those features, other than the zen vision:m does a good job with it. my quick review of the creative zen vision:m mp3/video player. as you can see from my review, the pros far outweigh the cons, and it\\'s just an overall excellent player. best player available today if you own this player, join the best fansite available for it: epizenter.net. the features packed into the vision:m is better than any other player you will see today. forget ipods, they can not even compare with this player. add the best looking gui, extra features like fm radio, voice recording, etc..all for the same price as an ipod and you\\'ll see why this player one best in show at the most popular consumer electronics show. this one has exceeded my expectations! sound quality- omg! crisp, clear, good volume. big improvement over the archos, and i had thought the archos was good, but this one blows it away. ease of use- the software, despite what others have said, is really simple. but the book is really clear and simple. size- a deck of cards in size and weight, almost exactly! i highly recommend this player. awesome player!!!!! this player is the dream mp3!!!! it has everything i had dreamed of on it!!!! it is better than the ipod because it has an fm radio on it and you can get more for your money!!! creative zen vision:m 30gb: shipped quick, ripped and jammin\\' the creative zen vision m is snap... total entertainment in the first mp3 i\\'ve ever owned. graphics are great! sound qualilty is excellent. amazon shipped this much faster than i expected, that was a bonus! touch pad has tons of options/settings you can adjust to your preferences. the creative vision: m, upon inspection when i recieved it, was a quantom leap ahead of its predecessor. the vibrant 2.5\\' lcd dominate ipod video\\'s with its slightly-larger size and more vibrant/numerous color pallete. setting this player up and sync\\'ing it with windows media player was a snap. so really, if you can get over the aweful navigational touch-pad, then i whole-heartedly recommend this over an ipod. its music quality, lcd are much better. hands down this is the best video / mp-3 player out to date. it\\'s well built feels good in your hand and does just about anything you want it to. fm tuner is just another plus that apple doesn\\'t have. bottom line this player not only looks as nice as the ipod but performs better with no restrictions on what it plays. outstanding movie & music player! i\\'ve had the zen vision m for two weeks now and i\\'m very happy - wish i\\'d bought it sooner - but i like to research purchases like this for quite a while before taking the plunge. this is my first hd-based mp3 player and it simply does everything i need it to -- worth every penny. - flexible - you have some software choices. the new version works with the zen seamlessly. 2) i found a video converter that seems faster than the creative one. it\\'s made by iriver (iriverter) but i don\\'t care as long as it\\'s faster and works the way i like it - i pick a directory and it does all the files for me. - screen: the screen is amazing - bright vivid colors - i wasn\\'t sure a 2.5\" lcd would work for me but i wanted it to because of the compact size of the overall unit. very impressive - no eye strain. cons: - only one - i like that i have options for software i can use with this device (unlike ipod). but i persisted, tried different earphones, listened to the same tracks on different devices, and it suddenly dawned on me... i had the bass problem not the zen vision m. i was used to hearing boom - with the vision m i actually hear bass, and the clarity, and sound imagery is exceptional. couple it with a pair of ultimate ears super.fi 5 pro\\'s for a truely wonderful listening experience. some are even better than the ipod(it may be hard to believe, i know). a screen of 262 thousand colors, an fm radio, a microphone and radio recorder, customizable backgrounds, innovative buttons, a great navigation system and much much more. with all these extra features how can you not love the creative zen vision. the extra weight makes it seem more protected and more durable. however, if you are open to anything other than itunes, then you will like creative\\'s software a lot. putting songs and movies on there is a snap, as easy or easier than itunes. after watching movies and seeing the gorgeous screen of the zen vision m, i knew that this piece of technology was better than the ipod. movies come in crisp and clear with perfect brightness and contrast. the sound of the movies and songs are excellent. creative once again proves that it\\'s a great producer of good sound quality. i recommend this mp3 player after more than two months of using it. however, if you can handle something a little more complicated, better looking and sounding, and with software different from itunes, then the creative zen vision m is perfect for you. outstanding product have had for over a month now and have found it to be excellent quality and possessing outstanding sound output. zen vision m black i love this product. it is way better then the ipod. it has longer battery life, better screen with more colors, supports a huge amount of video and audio formats, has a built in radio and voice recorder. it can even record radio. i have has it for about a month now, and i love very thing about it except a few things. you can get one here http://www.shieldzone.com/ besides that the product is amazing. the screen is much brighter then the ipod. the voice recorder is very good also. the quality is very good. the mic is very sensitive and catches that sound, however it does not bothersome and the lecture can still be heard just fine. it blows the ipod away on all fronts: - the best user interfact imaginable. simple, quick, intuitive. - battery lasts forever - screen is awesome - the overall feel of the thing- it\\'s hard to describe how good it is. - fm radio - it opens in windows using a simple exlporer window- what could be easier? but the product is truly worthy of all this and more. this product blows my mind with how good it is. first off, the sound quality is amazing. it has a custom eq, which is something i love, and the earbuds it comes with take a bit of getting used to, as in how to put them in, but once you do, you will be amazed at how great everything sounds. it is absolutely gorgeous, and shows amazing color. watching videos is terrific because of how good everything looks. it\\'s nice and bright, and is very slick when it fades to darkness. speaking of the battery life, it\\'s great. i don\\'t see why anyone could pass this product up, it\\'s amazing. better than ipod i bought this mp3 player after several researches. i bought it on may 20, 2006 and immediately fell in love with it. it has everythings that ipod has and more. one of the nicest thing about this player is fm radio, it has auto scan and sound is great. it has higher screen resolution than ipod and the video is also outstanding. i would recommend this player to anyone who is looking to buy one. also the sound quality is very good. the controls are easy enough to figure out even without the manual and the software that comes with the player is easy to use as well, though you can just use musicmatch or something along those lines. overall i have to say this player definitely defeats the ipod any day. also, the picture quality of the unit- absolutely amazing. it\\'s much better than the lcd screen on my camera, even my computer. it includes zoom, brightness and contrast controls, and you can convert the pictures into black and white, sepia, and two other neat settings. the video- amazing as well and the battery life is very good. zen m 30 delivers as promised the zen m 30 works just as promised. after only a few minutes i mastered the slide and button controls which i find easier to use than our ipod mini. i also appreciate the ability to remove a file from the zen m 30 directly with the \\'remove\\' fundtion. the battery life is greater than 10 hours as compared to the disappointing battery life of our mini ipod. the wonderful crisp large screen works well in daylight and the zen m 30 is what i now use as my mobile family picture album. great player; marginal video ripping software i love this unit (my third mp3/video player), but ripping videos from dvds using the supplied software just doesn\\'t work well. now, with the zen\\'s microphone/recording feature, i\\'m able to use it to record my interviews, and it\\'s easier to transcribe because of its clear, crisp recording quality. sound quality is great with volume equalizer and music genre presets. i\\'ve not had a single problem with my replacement zen, and i don\\'t really think i will but i got the best buy 2 year plan just in case. spiffy player- worth the money my zen vision:m was my first foray into the world of hard-drive mp3 players, before buying it i had only used flash-based players with significantly less memory. i personally think that they\\'re worth the extra cash and that the added bulk is nice- it makes the player feel more durable and overall better-built than an ipod (which have a reputation for being rather fragile anyway). the included software is adequate- nice user interface and very easy to use. transferring music is done quickly and with relative ease. battery life is good, and i\\'ve found that it tends to live up to manufacturer claims. the player can be charged either with your computer or with an ac adapter, and trust me, the includion of the ac adapter is a nice touch. screen quality is, in my opinion, quite superior to ipod\\'s: colors are brighter and and photos/videos really look great for such a little screen. i have had very little trouble with the player freezing/malfunctioning, so i can\\'t comment on tech support or troubleshooting. the player is easy to use, and the controls are very intuitive- volume is easily accessed from any point and menus are nicely organized. the \"random play all\" feature is actually quite reliable compared to other players i\\'ve owned- little repetition or songs that seem to come up too often. the ability to delete files from the player is unexpectedly handy, too. overall, just a spiffy little player- not perfect and not for everyone, but a great choice nonetheless. great product, especially compared to ipod i did a lot of research before i bought an mp3 player, and i\\'m pretty glad i bought this one. you can also use the sync manager on your computer to customize playlists on the vision:m. video plays in excellent quality, and is still visible from the extreme right or left of the screen, meaning people beside you can see it. the sound quality is good, although the bass is a little lacking. the clarity of the video and quality of the audio is great, it\\'s a huge capacity (most people don\\'t have 10,000 songs on their computer), and it\\'s incredibly versatile and functional. very good player. though its slightly thicker than the ipod, i like the features and navigation in this thing better than the ipod. pros of creative would include better resolution, better navigation (particularly right click menu), drag and drop, more supported audio / video formats, fm radio / recorder, voice recorder etc. simple, great sound, durable and, equally important, software that was a breeze to use when transferring files or just setting up a music library. so..........i went ahead and bought the zen m. what a great product, especially compared to ipod. navigation is a breeze, video is crisp, controls are easy to use and it\\'s got an fm receiver to boot. full review i purchased my zen a few weeks ago and felt it necessary to wait a certain length of time in order to be accurate and now that i have i can say without a doubt that this is the best purchase i have made in a while electronics wise, i researched read hundreds of reviews and compared til i recieved it, it shipped early and is absolutely glorious, the screen itself is the object of envy and i can say that honestly it\\'s one of the best mp3\\'s on the market i have bought and compared it to everything from dell dj to ipods this is the best, the sound is spectacular, you do need to reset it if it freezes but its not a big deal its only froze once or twice and only then because of the program i was playing, i urge you to do your own research and decide whats best for you but strongly consider this mp3, it surpasses that of many others, and its very easy to use and the touchpad isnt difficult to maneuver once you get used to it like any other control pad just the zen explorer, which, by the way, integrates cleanly into windows explorer, nice! there are many, many other features to this superbly engineered product. better than an ipod i bought this product because i wanted to be able to use the napster unlimited service for music. it works flawlessly. the screen is clear and bright. way more pixels than an ipod (63k vs 250k colors) clever and intuitive controls for navigation work extemely well. copying items to the unit couldn\\'t be easier because it acts as a usb mass storage device. fits easily in pocket and controls lock to keep from accidentally pushing the buttons. quality construction, great sound with lots of volume. when plugged into the car radio auxillary input plug it automatically activates without pushing any buttons and instantly resumes play where you left off. battery life is good. more versatile than most others on the market as far as file formats are concerned. any video files you may have which are not usable can easily be converted using the included software. the screen is smaller than a zune (same as ipod), but it\\'s way cheaper and the overall package is smaller (than zune) meaning better portability. i love it and would quickly buy it again over either of the competitors, even if price wasn\\'t an issue. zen vision m is a superior player. the zvm has: *longer battery life - zvm video lasts about 4 hours - which is twice as much as ipod. as a result, i don\\'t have to worry about the player running out of juice at the end of a movie like with the ipod video. *digital camera storage - the zvm can directly store my photos from my digital camera so that i don\\'t need to bring along a computer to store my photos when i travel - just plug my camera to the zvm, download photos, then erase my camera\\'s card to take more pictures. *hard drive capabilities - the zvm acts like a hard drive. for example, i can go to my friend\\'s computer and copy all the music/video/etc files i like with drag-and-drop ease. also, i can now store very large powerpoint files on the zvm so that my work presentations have a better bang - and i get better results. *multiple file format support - the zvm plays a lot of video file format\\'s that i already have such as divx, xvid and wma. *software ease-of-use: with the zvm, i don\\'t have to rely on itunes to get files loaded onto the player. itunes program isn\\'t bad, but sometimes i think it is a little cumbersome. *better screen: the zvm has a better screen than the video ipod. *accessory support: for $25.00, amazon.com sells a combo that includes an ac adaptor, car charger adaptor, direct usb cable (no need for included zvm dongle), and a battery pack (uses 4-aa batteries) for those long flights. *fm radio: despite a large library of songs, it\\'s nice to be able to hear fresh music over the radio. *recording capability: the zvm can record fm radio. but for me, i like the fact that i can put my blackberry on speakerphone and then use the zvm to record the conversation for business legal and future reference. *short-cut key and easy navigation: the short-cut key is great; i have mine set to the microphone record function. i haven\\'t had any problems with the zvm\\'s navigation on screen. *multiple subscription service support: although i haven\\'t used them all, i hear the music subscription support is great. *customizable eq: the zvm has preset eqs also, but i prefer to set the eq my way. if i could choose one word for the zvm, it would be - versatile. i just like the features the zvm has. for now however, i\\'m more than satisfied with the zvm. it\\'s a great all-around media player. creative zen vision m excellent product and great alternative to ipod. the creative product works great with all media except apple\\'s, of course. great menu and controls. fantastic playback ability and picture quality (brightness, contrast etc.) took a little while getting used to the slide bar, but much better control that the zen touch, my previous media player. with these two (free) programs and a little trial and error, i have been able to copy any dvd in my collection to the zen vision m. i wasn\\'t able to get the vision m to load movies that were ripped at the default settings of autogk (which is about 1.2 gig), but if you save them at about 355 meg (the 1/2 cd option), they will load just fine, with acceptable video quality and above-average sound. i hope this helps some of you who want to watch movies on your vision m. it took me a while to find the right software to do the job, but now that i have it i couldn\\'t be happier. great player, superb video display resolution, and tons of nifty features including customizable wallpaper backgrounds, a personal scheduler, and more. the accompanying software simplifies synching the player with your pc and transferring media files is a snap. there is also decent file support for a good number of video formats and an included fm tuner. having this ability in the zen vision m is a nice plus. i will maintain the 4 star review on the sole grounds of the sheer quality and overall excellency of this product. very nice, but........... i bought this for my 16 yr. old daughter and she loves it. the sound quality is better along with the picture quality. plus, they liked other features the zen vision has that the ipod doesn\\'t have. it was much better than the ipod to me (and still is) and it was so easy to use. i primarily was using it as an audio player when i traveled and worked out at the gym and i had not one single problem with it. so let\\'s start with the good: -the screen is bright and colorful and easy to view -the touchstrip control takes some getting used to, but it\\'s much easier than other players on the market -the sound quality is excellent with various eq settings including a custom setting which many other players lack -easy to transfer music whether you drag and drop or use the included zen software -great battery life lately i\\'ve been reading reviews all over the web praising this player and showering it with various accolades. my data was retained, but i shouldn\\'t have to worry about the player locking up when i want to use it. all in all the creative zen vision:m is a good player, but it\\'s hampered by problems that an pvp should not have. i love the zen m!!! even the salesperson who helped me at frys returned his ipod and purchased this, lol notable differences: better screen quality, better programming, being able to download from several sites, doesn\\'t scratch as easily as the ipod!!! the radio is awesome! recording from the radio is very, very, very good, not excellent though...but hey, i will still definately use this feature. the recorder is pretty darn good, i just purchased a digital recorder two days ago for $100. this is a valuable feature for all those college kids! i couldn\\'t help but to notice that everyone who is loyal to ipod gave this product one star. solid features give plenty of bang for the buck, excellent pmp first off let me say i have experimented with the ipod video (friend got it for xmas) and generally liked it. i like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player (pmp). sound quality for music is very good, with an eq to tweak to individual tastes. 2- video quality is top notch, with several different formats supported. it was quite easy to transfer recordings from my snapstream pvr setup on the pc to the vision:m, so now i have several episodes of the simpsons, scrubs, and 60 minutes to watch during trips. however, the zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand. i have no problem at all with the size. it\\'s plenty small. i\\'ve noticed some people claim creative has ripped off ipod for the look, but really, the creative zen micro mp3 player (about 2 years old) is what struck me as a near replica as far as size/design goes. features like microphone recording, fm play and record, outlook calendar / contacts compatibility, etc. with the upcoming vast increase in choices for video, podcast and music download availability (as evidenced by recent announcements at ces and elsewhere), the zen video:m should be a great choice for anyone who rates features/quality over the \"hipness\" factor ipod currently has over the masses. great player but set touchpad sensitivity to low this a great player. a touchpad on **normal** sensitivity setting is great for navigating a big laptop screen but for the zen\\'s relatively tiny screen (great screen btw) you\\'ll be all over the place. everything i\\'ve tried with this mp3 player is great, good interface, fast, long battery life, the zen is just very well designed. although the interface/buttons on the player are good, there is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the buttons do but with some practice and consulting the user manual (which is kind of meh in my opinion), it can be mastered in a few hours. 2.5\" color screen is great on the eyes and photos and movies can easily be viewed. sound is great (fm and mp3). the benchmark has been raised on apple - i have bought 3 apples and this unit is best at the moment. it came down to the replaceable battery for the ipod or the 10x better graphics for the zen. really nice graphics. really fun toy! the creative zen vision m is the best pvp in the market today creative has finally struck gold with this release, as the creative zen vision:m is undoubtedly the best pvp on the market today. most creative products tend to be judged soley on how they compare to the ipod, and while that\\'s convienent for potential buyers, the creative zen vision:m is a good enough product to stand on it\\'s own. the screen is absolutely dazzling. it is incredibly bright and the rich colors seem to pop right off of the screen. thankfully, creative has not put this screen to waste, as the zen vision:m has the best native video support of any of the players in the mp3 player/video player bracket. still, you\\'ll primarily be buying this as a music player, and it stacks up even better in that department, with pristine sound quality. intergration is absolutely seamless with windows media player 11. plug it in via usb, hit the sync tab in wmp and let the rest take care of itself. better than the ipod video i found this player just before i was going to buy a new video ipod. i just got the player and its incredible. the sound and video quality is the best ive seen, and very customizable. the fm tuner and voice recorder are great, since i do not have to buy accerories for it,its embedded in the zen vision m. like i said, the sound quality is much better than the ipod. the earphones themselves held up to a bass test that the ipod earphones could not handle without alot of distortion. apart from that,it is a perfect machine and is, in my opinion, after using the ipod video several times,a better quality device than the ipod creative zen vision: m i am overall very impressed with the zen vision m. i like the user interface and overall performance. i love the built in radio and voice recorder. i would choose the zen vision m over the ipod any day. i had to cut the tape to fit but it has worked great. best media player i have ever owned! the creative zen vision:m. it actually has a higher resolution than the ipod video. the device converts almost any video or audio to a format supported by the zen as long as your pc has the codec installed (quicktime to windows media for example). the menu system, after learning it is very intuitive and the best i have seen. the menu\\'s are stylish and can be skinned. i was able watch videos on my flights without any problems with my eyes. as for sound, the audio sounds as good as, if not better than, the ipods without the eq on. turning it on makes it even better. the battery life is amazing as well. i was able to go 5 days on all commutes listening to music and only spent half the battery. excellent device i\\'ve had my zvm for a couple of months now. it\\'s awesome. rapid scroll by touching the bottom/top edges instead of 40 swirls around an ipod scroll wheel). overall, a great product. after my mess with the zen neeon, i was a little skepticalabout creative, but i absolutely love my vision m. the color case is amazingly shiny and bright (which makes me happy). i\\'ve had no problems importing my music and pictures, making playlists, changing menu option, etc. i\\'m not a sound snob, but i think the quality is really good. best portable video/mp3 player i researched online for awhile and the creative vision m is the best video/mp3 player because its screen is superior and the vision m can easily play (without further conversion/encoding) many video formats. so far the most fun i have had with my vision m is being able to transfer all the tv shows i download to my player in a matter of minutes -- then hook up the av cable and i can watch them in great quality (every bit as good as the computer) from the comfort of my tv. of course, the vision m is also a mp3 player and i have taken the time to transfer my entire music collection to my player. sound quality is very nice too. and then there is even more features - photos, fm radio, microphone, organizer, removable disk space and 30 gb of space!! this is a great player!! it really is an i-pod killer the creative zen vision m is by far better than the i-pod video. the zen vision m or zvm for short supports more video formats such as avi divx(tm) 4 & 55, xvid5, mpeg-1, mpeg-2, mpeg4-sp, wmv9, and motion-jpeg. also supports audio formats such as mp3, wav, and wma. when you purchase the zvm you get the full accessories such as earphones, sync adapter, usb 2.0 cable, travel adapter to charge the zvm via electrical outlet, pouch, user\\'s guide, installation cd (includes creative mediasource(tm) and creative media explorer software, or you can use windows media player). the zvm also comes with fm turner, and voice recorder. the zvm is better, brighter, and more powerful than the i-pod. great product but recently damaged by creative firmware i love my zen vision m, which i purchased about three weeks ago. it is beautiful and has most of the features i could ever want. however the product works very well. i couldn\\'t ask for an easier device for recording. it\\'s fast and easy. photos are simple to transfer also. battery life has been very good. i find the controls very easy to use. i like the way the unit feels in the hand. it\\'s small, but not too small. i bought the pretty powder blue player. i think the colors are pretty. for $200 or less, i don\\'t think you could get a better 30 gig mp3 and video player. i tried it, and it works! thanks creative for putting out a fantastic product! the prices were within $20 of each other, each had the qualities i was looking for (the zen being a little bigger in size), and each would hold all my music. but the zen had the added benefits of a microphone, radio, and personalized background options that ipod didn\\'t offer. but as i\\'ve gotten used to it, the zen has proven to be extremely easy to function, although i have yet to master the program on the computer. the radio is an added bonus, the organization of the zen is excellent, i can now fit all 3000 of my songs, plus music videos, tv shows, and movies, and the battery life has lasted up to 14 hours, as the advertisement promised. although it is easy to reset (simply use a paperclip or safety pin to press the reset button on the bottom of the player), i was surprised about the consistency of it. overall, i was very satisfied with the creative zen vison:m 30gb and would recommend it over the apple ipod. briefly, i was very pleased with the audio quality. the video quality is very good also, considering the tiny screen. the mechanical ergonomics and user interface takes a little getting used to, but overall, creative did a fine job. the creative labs user forums are very active, and should be a good source for help on the issues you may encounter. i have used my zen micro with napster and yahoo music service, both are excellent. decided to upgrade to the new vision:m and i must say creative has done a wonderful job. the user interface is improved, mostly due to a larger color screen. addition of accessory port on the bottom is a huge plus, even though there are not many devices yet. battery life is very much improved, watched 2 hour video and listened to 3 hours of wma protected files and still had half the battery life. video looked great. great player, a good choice. i would first off love to say that i respect apple and the ipods are great. anyway the zen vision:m is an amazing player. its got a beautiful screen and amazing video quality. the navigation system is quite interesting and takes a couple of days to master. its touch pad is sensitive making scrolling easy. also in my opinion its a sleek player. the smooth black with the white backplate is elegant. the earbuds were comfortable and the audio quality and the amount of sound impresses me. it is bigger than a 60g ipod but i have become used to the feel of 3rd generation ipods and this one feels comfortable in my hand. the software was basic enough and i found it easy to use. also what i like about this player is the ability to set backrounds. the video quality is really quite astounding. the sound quality is pretty good, though i don\\'t know how everyone else rates it--some are satisfied, others seek something better. i don\\'t know why some people have issues with its thickness and like to compare it to the thinner ipod, but it\\'s a nice and light little thing, in my opinion. perhaps i\\'m just easily pleased, but i had no problems with transferring data or media to my player, and i can even transfer my stuff without installing the software. the shiny surface also tends to scratch easily (i kept my player in the included pouch and it still got some scratches), so it would be really cool if something like the iskin were developed for the zen vision:m. overall, this is a pretty nice gadget, guaranteed to keep you entertained for a long time as well as turn some heads. i\\'ve been using this player pretty consistently and i must say i still don\\'t have major problems with it, apart from a fairly slow start-up, and for some reason, the clock sometimes resets to a different time, so i have to adjust it all over again. nice, solid player pros: --great capacity and media abilities --stable environment --good controls (takes a little while to get used to but very flexible once you do) --easy software as well as many software options (not limited to itunes) --reasonable battery life (8+ hrs. just playing music) --very crips, clear display --excellent sound and flexible audio controls --shortcut button is customizeable cons: --screen scratches and smudges easily --lack of accessories --proprietary charger/usb interface (also meaning you can\\'t charge in the car until they make such an accessory) i use my vision:m daily in an industrial environment and have even dropped it twice, but it did not even stop playing. i purchased a \"marware sportsuit sleeve\" (says it will fit all ipods including new 3g ipods but easily fits the vision:m) and it is a great case for those who will use thier player in a variety of conditions as it has padded sides and plastic inserts for impact protection, repels water, and has a removeable belt clip. all in all i am very pleased with my vision:m and highly recommend it. the first time i turned it on, it had a crisp, colorful, and bright screen. i was pleasantly surprised to see how bright the screen was at only 50% brightness. sound quality is more than you can ask for with its customizable eq. battery life is great. accessories i plan to buy as they become available: -a/v cable (to connect and view media on tv) -iriver fm transmitter (heard good reviews on amazon.com) accessories that i\\'ve purchased already: -boxwave flexiskin case (silicone case that fits well) -boxwave screen protector (doesn\\'t completely cover the front and sides, but combined with the flexiskin, does its job well) all in all, i\\'m extremely pleased with this product. too good... great sound quality, excellent battery life and amazing functions... u gotta get used to the ultra sensetive scroll bar though... but that happens in a day/two... the only downside (for which i am not giving it a 5 star) is its surface.. despite the fact that u take extreme care, u never know where those minute scratches come from...?? but all in all: its simply fantastic...! i like it better than that pod thingy i have one of those pod thingies. it\\'s very nice. it is pricey but i don\\'t plan on replacing the batteries all that often. i really like this feature. and the color display is very bright and easy to see. this is cool! this is another unexpected delight. it is definitely not as sensitive as the pod; it requires more force, which i definitely like. it ran great. i played music all week (charging from a 12vdc adaptor) and it was great. quality alternative to ipod player offers more features than most on market: music (in a number of formats), video, pictures, radio, and voice recorder. overall, good product! very customizable excellent player in order to use this creative zen vision m (any color) mp3 player. it came also with a \\'usb mini-b cable wire\\', a nice \\'light brown white kinda looking pouch\\', very nice sounding \\'creative earbuds\\' (but if you have headphones thats a $10 vaule or more it sounds really excellent without using the equalizer settings). excellent product the creative zen vision:m 30gb mp3 and video player is an awesome product at a very affordable price. after giving it a lot of thought i decided to go for this product since it has more features and its flaws (when compared to the ipod) are negligible. - microphone - fm tuner (integrated) - support for more formats (music and video) - support for more softwares (you don\\'t need to use a specific software like itunes) considering all these, i decided to choose the zen vision:m over the ipod and i\\'m very glad i did. it\\'s an awesome product and you all should try it out ;) creative beats apple... again this is really a great product. the screen is brilliant, and the video quality is astounding. the audio quality is as good, if not better, than the ipod. the best feature of the player is the ability to play subscription music. one of the coolest features of the player is the ability to change the backround. the player is relatively thin, beaten only by the ipod. however, the video battery life is double that of the ipod(4 hours compared to 2 hours). pros: -works with subscription music -supports subscription music services -decent controls -changeable backrounds:p cons: -lack of acessories -no itunes-like video support(maybe amazon unbox or movielink) so if you want the best, this is the best. the fm tuner and the built in microphone are bonuses that i would not miss. you can record from fm and i love recording my one year old\\'s voice using the built in microphone. a car fm transmitter and a pair of portable speakers (you could even go in for the 3-piece speaker system) has made the media player inseparable from me. the sound quality is good and so is the vision clarity. it\\'s a comfortable fit in the palm of my hand and one-hand operation is no sweat. navigating thru the menus is a breeze.. especially if you are a windows user, you are a pro right from start.. you would know where to find what (the secret of the right-click(context) menus and the comfort of the short-cut button)!! you can sync using windows media player... one stop shop for all your ripping and synchronising needs (you would still need to install the player before you can use win media player, though, but can forget about the additional \"tuney\" softwares). well, if you need any reason to choose this over the ipod, think what good an fm tuner and a built-in microphone could do for you! i\\'m happy to report that i have not yet been dissappointed. the zen seemed to have everything that you can want in an mp3 player and then some. a big selling point was the fm radio and recording capabilities that the others especially the ipod do not have. zen\\'s sound is amazing, the display is bright and large, its easy to navigate through the menus, and the included software is a breeze. it also includes a calendar, has a voice recorder, and can be used as an external memory stick. also, the sensativity can easily be adjusted from the options menu. i was very willing to pay whatever it cost to have the best mp3 that would entertain me during my 1 hour work commute (each way) and daily work-outs at the gym. the creative zen vision:m is an excellent player. the creative software that comes with the player is very good for those people not in love with windows media player. the sound and video is of the best quality i\\'ve seen in any player. the controls and usability are of the greatest design. i highly recommend the zen vision:m so, i got this one and i\\'m quite pleased with it. the zen comes with everything you need to use it (e.g. i bought new headphones because i hate ear buds, but the ones included had decent sound quality (typically, \"freebie\" headphones are awful). the screen has pretty amazing resolution for a 2 1/2 inch screen. but the picture is sharp and clear and the colors are vibrant. the player itself couldn\\'t be easier to operate. so far, no problems (knock on wood). i didn\\'t have to wait for someone to pick up, and i received instant, helpful and friendly assistance. the good news: after only 6 business days, i have my new zen. creative\\'s customer service was great. i got mine like a week ago and man i love this thing ! i can\\'t lie at first i was kinda scared that it might not be as great as the creative zen micro i have but all that changed after 2 days using it . the quality is great the sounds is superb , it is not limited as the ipod video in options , let\\'s be real there is need to think just get one . a+ for creative ! great quality and ease of use the creative zen vision:m is my first mp3 player and i am delighted with it. despite its hefty price, all i can say is: it\\'s worth it. sound quality is stupendous, navigation between functions is intuitive (i barely skimmed the manual), the screen has great quality, the player\\'s software works well (and you can always resort to windows media player if you prefer). i have no problems with the navigation buttons despite knowing of other users\\' issues with their sensitivity. i love it that i can use a portion of the 30 gb hard disk as an external drive, sparing me the extra expense of a pen drive. best mp3 player out there.... 4.5 stars i didn\\'t buy this from amazon but i did buy one and i have to say this is the best mp3 player out on the market. battery life is incredible. i love watching my tv shows on it. but other than that this product is incredible. awsome media player! without restating all the technical issues, this player is wonderful. the video, which i didn\\'t intend to use, is sharp and simple to load using the included software or wmp10. screen bright and battery life strong. works great as a storage device. but most important, it is easy to use, and sounds great as an audio player. also, i purchased the invisible shield at shieldzone.com and this protectes the screen and body beautifully. this is my favorite new toy! great value mp3 player this is my 2nd mp3 player from creative. i also like to use this device to stream svis to my tv, i can download movies on the pc and then watch on the tv, you will need a cable for this, my old one from my sony camcorder did the job nicely. the touchpad takes a little getting used to but it\\'s easy enough and the software is simple and responsive. it\\'s a perfect size, i would not want anything smaller to be honest. apart from this minor issue, i recommend this highly and it appears to be much better value than the ipod when you take into account all the extra features. the battery life is adequate for day to day use. the zen vision: m comes with an ac charger that is much faster than usb charging. the sound quality is remarkable. the player is suprisingly tough as i have accidently dropped it onto concrete or onto wooden floors on numerous occasions without any damage. an awesome mp3 player! just got the zen today and its amazing. i was thinking about geting the 30gb ipod but i liked the features the zen had over the ipod such as the built in fm tuner. the zen also has a much better screen then the ipod. i have had this for 2 months now and have been very impressed, i found when i was travelling i was viewing video\\'s and photo\\'s a lot and the amazing screen of the vision m made this all the more enjoyable. i was very cloes to buying an ipod but the superior battery life, screen and fm tuner swung me towards zen. there are some trade-offs however, ipod had more accessories, better software, looks cooler, and can be used with pc\\'s and apple whereas the zen can really only be used for pc\\'s :( overall i am very impressed with the vision m the ultimate mp3 player i bought this mp3 player 5 months ago and i can tell the diference between and ipod video and other portable video players. advice: install the software before you connect the player to your pc and you\\'ll avoid a lots of problems pros: hi screen resolution (260,000 colors vrs 64,000 colors from ipod video) awesome sound quality (has the creative seal) a custom image can be used as background support almost any video format without conversion (divx, avi, mpg, mpeg, wmv) except mov :( i like the touch pad and the menu (it could be a con for other peolple) radio and voice recorder schedule and calendar sync with microsoft outlook alarm clock cons: scrachts comes so easily the battery should last more is thicker than the ipod its kind of heavy it takes too much time to charge with the usb and i think that\\'s it, if i remember something else i\\'ll update the review if you are looking for a good mp3 forget about ipod nd get this one you wont regret it. great player/recorder this year i bought the vision:m 30 for my wife. they have all worked well, but i liked the ability to get away from itunes with my own zen. the new vision:m 30 works well, and it gives faster touch response than my larger zen vision. this zen vision m:30 has an adjustable control and can be made to respond to a thunky adult touch, but once a decision is made, it responds very quickly: very nice indeed. another thing: the size of the zen vision:m 30 is larger and this is a good thing. the buttons on this device are big and easy to use. i love how i barely have to touch the center \"dial\" to make something work. the menu test is not to small to read and i can see everything clearing from a distance. the power button and \"lock\" feature also works well. this is definately a 5-star device!!! i had to order some other \"over-the-head\" headphones and they seem to work great. great piece of technology!!! i chose the zen over all these for the following reasons: easier to use software than ipod\\'s itunes, more capacity at a similar price than the sansa; fm/voice recording capability lacking in the zune. for the price this is a great package: 30gb capacity, good earphones in the box, fm tuner/recorder/voice recorder, easy to use software. makes it real easy to manage your podcasts. it worked good out of the box, but the newer firmware made a noticeable improvement. 1) amazing...just one word to describe the screen... video resolution is dependant on what video quality u throw at it... 2) battery charges up fast...i charged for 15 mins...and used it for 3 hrs...(playing videos and songs) 3) i donno what is all the talk abt the navigation...it is very easy to use. 4) i havent had issues with installing the software...installation was easy...and importantly transferring files is just like transferring to any usb flash drive. its that easy. the creative zen vision m has it all! one of the best things about this device is that you don\\'t have to install any of the creative software that comes with it! the adjustment/learning curve for the controls on this device is pretty easy and i am comfortable using it. in addition to playing windows media files, this bad boy plays my tivo files without any special conversion necessary. i just transfer the tivo files from my tivo to my pc, then use windows media player to sync my tivo files to my creative zen vision m. the fm radio tuner/recording feature is nice, but i admit that i am probably not going to get much use out of that, except during football season. this is a wonderful device and i am highly impressed. this is the best mp3 player i have ever had. i did extensive reviews before buying the new vision:m and it is without a doubt one awsome all-in-one device. i have used the new zencast to download video and podcasts, all with no trouble. )...really cool feature. using it as a hard drive is super easy, and you don\\'t need creative\\'s software to move data like some suggest, although you can use it if you choose. adding music is very easy with both the creative software and media player 10, with no problems at all. i have had no problems, no freezing and no skipping. the screen\\'s clearity is amazingly bright and clear. i had a zen sleek before i bought this player, so i\\'m used to the touch pad which i really like. but, it actually feels solid and well built. i have not owned an ipod and wouldn\\'t want one after owning the vsion:m. the new zen vision:m is everything i was hoping it would be, and more. great peice of equipment the creative zen vision:m is a great peice of hardware. then i turned it on... first thing you notice, the screen is beautiful. i can\\'t reiterate that enough, it is unbelievable how clear and vibrant the screen is. i sync\\'ed a few cd\\'s to it, and listened, the sound quality is superb. you\\'d think watching shows on the 2 inch screen would be ridiculous, but the quality makes it a very enjoyable experience. the playforsure software is great too, just plug it into any computer with wmp10 and you can synce music/vidoes/pictures. it wasnt painless, but nothing is. thrilled with my zen vision this player is a breath of fresh air compared to my previous mp3 player, the samsung \"napster\" yp-910. the first thing that struck me was the beautiful, colorful display. after many months, the fun of using it has not worn off. although i didn\\'t expect to store pictures and videos on it, i have found it a nice feature that i have been using. since i\\'ve only had the one crummy player to compare to, i can tell potential buyers what features i enjoy now with the zen vision that my old player did not offer: - allows deletion of unwanted songs/files from within the player (my old player required the napster or wmp software to do this). - works with a number of music programs, besides the software that shipped with it. media monkey is nice for sychronizing my music files over my home network with my two computers. music match has a nice duplicate file finder. fortunately, the player works flawlessly with all of these programs. it also works fine with the napster software, which is important since i have a membership with napster. - best feature of all that my old player did not do: it will play the entire library of songs randomly. i\\'m so darn happy, i can\\'t report any flaws with the zen vision, except the item i mentioned about the creative software not showing all the player\\'s songs in one screen, but only folders by artist. i think anyone would enjoy using the zen vision, but anyone having used the samsung like i did will be absolutely thrilled. besides, it\\'s better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the zune, and a better battery than either one. xp found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think itunes) software, i was able to drop my non-drm ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available. the packaging is very small and tight. very solid and tight. as mentioned numerous times, the screen on this thing is just amazing. contrary to what you might think, i did not monkey around with it too much (fast forward, skip, volume, etc) for anything to mess with the battery. video is great, but reportedly sucks the life right out of the battery. in the first 24, i\\'ve got to say i\\'m impressed. great sound, video and screen puts this over the top. included software is nice, but get media monkey to handle everything. faster and no worries with album art. total shipped was under $185 and i couldn\\'t be happier with the purchase. love the zen... purchased the zen about a week ago, so this review is based on immediate results versus longterm usage. my priorities for a new player were as follows: -music first and foremost -photos -plenty of space for photos and tunes -possible occasional video use 30 gb appeared to be the best size for my budget and needs, and the zen was top rated on several reviews in this category. the screen was clear and crisp, and video playback was perfect for my needs. i also preferred the controls on the zen to the zune. the items i love about this player: -the controls and menu were very easy to pick up and intuitive. the slide bar many folks mention is \\'sensetive\\' did take me a day or so to get use to, but i love it. i can fly through menus and selections in less then a weeks use. -the screen is gorgeous, the colors are crisp and clear and everyone raves when they see photos or video on it. -set up took me under 5 minutes on my pc (windows xp), i didn\\'t have any problems or need to download any updates. i use rhapsody player for my music downloads (which i prefer over yahoo\\'s program), and it required no additional upgrades to communicate. -tranferring photos from my pc to the zen was easy as well, i have not tried video yet though. -the fm tuner works great, i work in an office building where most radios on desks have a difficult time picking up stations. the zen works better then any radio i have had here. the recording option for the radio is a great feature as well!! all in all, i am 110% satisfied with my decision. the creative zen vision: m is versitile, useful, and amazing for all the reasons everyone else has said. the most surprizing thing to me is the screen quality. the images are so translucent and lucid that it\\'s easy to be amazed by the video and picture display. it\\'s a great interactive lil gadget that\\'s sure to delight me for hours upon hours. sound quality: 9/10 video quality: 10/10 video battery: 9/10 audio battery: 10/10 revolutionariness: 10/10 overall: 9.9/10 this thing is amazing! bonuses +++ 1- waaaaaaaay better battery life over the ipod. 2- screen is amazing 4x the colors over the ipod. 4- has everything you need to get started with chargers and cords. 5- sexy as all hell. 7- uses more formats so i am not limited to itunes anymore yay! 8 creative software is extreamly easy to use. overall i have had this player for a week and all i can say is the hype is correct. the screen is absolutely gorgeous. another advantage is the compatability. mp3, wma, divx, xvid, wmv, mp4... your options are wide open! amazing player....so happy i got rid of the ipods i don\\'t feel like writing a long review b/c most of the great points of this player have already been pointed out. i can\\'t believe how nice the movies look on this thing. i also find the slider on this system to work better than the circular wheel on the ipods. i was incredibly impressed by customer reviews on product comparisons for the zen vision (which were better than those given for the ipod) and decided to order it. this player has everything i would ever need. the sound and picture/video quality is outstanding. brightness can also be adjusted more than how it originally arrives to you which impressed me because it was already great when i initially turned it on. custom and preset equalizer settings are also a plus. the zen also has a strong bass that is a must hear. i ordered the pink one and it was actually smaller than what i was expecting to receive, which is even better for me. i am thrilled that the software that comes with it is easy to use and that the player itself is compatible with napster to go, i literally drag and drop my songs and go. transfering other media onto the player is also a breeze. overall, i am happy with my player and i am glad that i wasn\\'t hit with the ipod bug and from the looks of it will never get near one thanks to creative. i love it. it has a fantastically clear lcd screen that makes its 2.5in screen seem much bigger. the slightly thicker size of the zen is actually a \"plus\" for me, as it makes it less slippery and i worry less about crushing it. i find the set up and touch pad very easy to use and find that the files are organized very well. the sound quality is excellent (i use my own headphones). uploading songs, pictures and video is extremely easy and quick. i also love that you can set a picture as your background, which is just neat. overall, i love my zen and would never choose anything else. all in all, it is a very decent mp3 player. other than those 4 very disappointing (and sneaky) weaknesses, the device is \"great\". now that i have lived with the iriver, zen, and ipod models for a while, i have to say that the ipod still has the best interface and usability. another reason to want the creative vision: m this thing is awesome! sure it\\'s bigger than an ipod, but in this case, bigger is better... there\\'s even more reason to love this thing, the price. for that price, there is nothing out there which can touch it. ps - do yourself a favor and download total video converter ver 2.52. free for 15 days of use and it converts every format, including flash and shockwave video (googlevideo & youtube) into any format you want, including ipod! the quality and feel of the creative zen video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. you can record directly from the integrated fm radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. zen vision:m supports many video formats, such as divx? the battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. if you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. today) and you don\\'t have to spend money on extra stuff already included. best player on the market i did my research before choosing a mp3 player.i checked out all the electronic reviews and all the owners opinion on thier products and creative seemed to be the choice.with so many compatible video and audio formats .also it came with a great kit which included a standard wall charger,built in fm radio and vioce recorder that it\\'s closest competitor did not offer.the screen is absolutley gorgous and i get many compliments from everyone.there are very few accesories availble for it but i hear belkin ,creative and other companies will bringing those out soon due to its popular demand.i am not alone in my opinion , my local electronics retailer has sold out within a few days and the creative web sites also says they are back ordered.get one while you can.creative really raised the bar with this player that everyone will soon have to follow .thanks creative for truly great product! first day downloading cd\\'s was great, easy. that\\'s quite alright, however, and it doesn\\'t detract at all from the wonderful player that is the creative zen. what i have used, however, which is almost everything, i\\'ve been incredibly impressed with. speaking for me, the 30g size is more than enough. it runs smoothly and intuitively, and, for those of you who are more hands-on (as i am), you can edit nearly every bit of info of every individual file using the included software. a couple small touches that i really like, that i\\'ve been told are not common among other players (though i could be wrong), are the abilities to delete files directly from the player, instead of using the computer interface, and the ability to build playlists on the go, or rather, to build a new now playing list every time, if you want. speaking of wmp, i really like the fact that it\\'s possible to upload files either through that, or through the media explorer software that\\'s included with the zen. it\\'s renewed my interest in music videos overall, which is the best compliment i can give it, and with the 10g of free space i still have, it\\'ll take a while to fill it up. granted, the screen is pretty small, in comparison to, say, a tv screen, but if your eyes are even moderately strong, you won\\'t have any problems. the picture display works wonderfully, too. they were all quite impressed....with the pics themselves, and with the display on the player. ahh, and before i forget, the battery life of the player has been pretty impressive, so far, though i haven\\'t used it for hours on end. right out of the box i had an easy time transferring all my files onto the player. putting videos was simple, and video conversion was not a hassle. the screen is absolutely beautiful and it has impressive battery. i actually prefer its controls to the ipods simple click wheel. it feels good, small and sturdy, in your hand. i especially like the recording and fm radio features, particularly useful for recording class lectures. overall this is a great product and simply amazing. it has very good codec support but it\\'s not perfect yet. if you are looking for a small video player though, this is much better than the ipod w/ video. the screen is considered better by reviewers and the improved codec support means less time transcoding your videos. a quick rundown: the vision: m has a better interface, better file handling, and a more vibrant screen. the screen on the vision: m is better looking. the ipod colors aren\\'t as rich, but the wider viewing angle doesn\\'t require any particular tilt to see the screen. battery life is similar between the two and you won\\'t notice a difference. apple\\'s player controls are easy to use and very responsive. the vision m: has a touchpad, which is also very responsive and easy to use. the breadth and depth of the functionality and options available in the vision: m are better. the vision: m, on the other hand, not only lets you easily transfer files back and forth, but also lets you organize them any way you want in folders on the player. with the vision: m, there is no need to spend time jumping through file format hoops. this player is simply amazing, the reason i don\\'t give it 5 stars is because i think there\\'s not an absolute perfect man made product in this world. some people complaint about this player being thicker than the ipod (not very much by the way), but keep in mind you get integrated fm radio, voice recorder, radio recorder, longer battery life, and much, much, much, definitely much better screen resolution and image quality. it\\'s very simple to use, you actually can use it without installing any software on your pc, by simply drag and drop media files. zen vision m is also much more compatible with almost any music download web-site, and this alone is a very important feature for those who want to use monthly unlimited music download subscriptions. with these new adittions, there\\'s no doubt in my mind that this is the best player in it\\'s type all around. the player operating system is very easy and intuitive to use too. finally, i will like to point out that the construction quality is superb. hey i think the ipod line of products are fantastic! of coarse the reason i chose the zen vision:m is because of its ability to play multiple formats of video. the zen vision:m gives a solid 4 hours of video playback time. i love it!!!! they are both great products. i love it and know that i made a great choice. i love the fm radio and use it everyday to catch the news weather,traffic,interviews,sermons,ect. it also has voice recording that sounds great. i also love the calander and event planner. another great feature is the ability to change the screen backgroud to personalize it. i find it very easy to navigate with one hand just using my thumb. this is a great product and would recomend the zen to anyone. just remember: even if you can afford to spend $1/song and be traped to itunes only, i would still recommend the zen just for the extra features,longer bat.life,and more color for video. it works great. the screen is phenomenal. the headphones, i thought, were pretty darn good, but i upgraded anyway b/c i had the $$$ available. - 30gb goes quickly with 192kbps mp3 files, and video and pictures. i bought some decent headphones and the sound quality on this thing is incredible, i am a musician and my life has now been blessed with new listening experiences daily. the battery life is great and i have watched full videos and music and photos (i put 10,000 of my digital photos on it as well as 22 gigs of music). the overall quality is great, it feels well built and the screen is simply amazing. i am also easily putting podcasts on here and you can use any podcasting service if you link it to the zencast software that comes with it! with this player i have full freedom and consider it an extension of all the files on my computer and subscription services, rather than only what i can pull through itunes. i have no problem with the size and i take it skiing with me. the bottom line is it\\'s a sweet player, great quality, with the player\\'s positives much outweighing its negatives. it has so many little details and options, making it that much more fun than what ipod has to offer. fresh out the box just received by creative zen 30gb today (i\\'m very excited). i just unpacked the unit and it looks very sleek (i purchased the black one). that upgrade on line was easy enough. during that i was able to see a very crisp and clean screen. anyway, installation was a breeze--popped in the setup disk and it walked me through the entire install without a problem. my first transfer of 1.12 gb was pretty quick (only a couple of minutes). okay--i undocked the unit and hit menu button, found videos and saw that my transferred movies were there--awesome and easy. my headphones are in and they are comfortable plug ins (with little cushions on the outside--unlike my ipod). the picture is crisp, clear and excellent...i\\'m loving it. the sound is awesome, a bit too loud, but i haven\\'t found the volume button. i will continue to test the unit and learn how to fully utilize it, but for now--this is a five star for me (i am so excited about being able to copy my movies to this unit!!!!) excellent mobile mp3 player/radio i have 3 ipods,1nano and 2mini\\'s apple makes a nice unit. that is extremely fast. the unit has played flawlessly the radio is as good as my cars pioneer (rode on motorcyle all over town and it never lost reception even while in my coat pocket)this unit is excellent and so far i havent found a downside to this purchase. this little baby is better than the ipod video, not a whole lot better, but it is still better and cheaper too boot. pros -colorful menus -customizable themes -set images as wallpaper -delete files directly on there without having to hook it to the computer -excellent video quality -excellent sound quality -easy to use interface -voice and sound record -radio -acts as and organizer and note taker -creative\\'s software is much easier than itunes, and it takes any file format (also because it has an easy to use file converter) -you dont have to pay to convert certain files (like the office, which you have to pay to convert with itunes) -sleek, don\\'t let people tell you its too chunky compared to the ipod. final note this is a great gift for anyone this christmas, definitly a better buy than the ipod video. i-pod killer i\\'ve had my creative zen for about 4 days and i\\'m loving it!!! the battery is amazing lasting as long as they say on the box. the software included makes it all extremely easy to do. also you don\\'t have to worry if you don\\'t have itunes cause the creative accepts windows media player! you can delete pictures right off the zen without having to hook it up to a pc. this thing is amazing!!! if you\\'re looking for a mp3 player that plays video and does slideshows here it is!!! the creative zen is amazing! best mp3 player out in the market i just got mine last week so i\\'ll just try to list some pros and cons pros - the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the ipod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for creative are not saturated to make them look better) - sound quality is also better, this coming from creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic. even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life, creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours. - though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, imo the size is perfect, it\\'s exactly the same as my 3rd generation ipod with a silicon case - fm radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do cons - internal battery so you can\\'t personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it\\'s easier to press - no \"on the go playlist\" like the ipod, if there is i haven\\'t found out how to do it yet i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5 i received the vision m yesterday, and have since downloaded and watched 2 tv shows-it works great! once i was able to get to the right screen and connect to the tv, it played beautiful on the screen. i am much happier since it is doing exactly what i bought it for, and it is doing it well. it hadn\\'t arrived yet and i was so anxious to use the player that i left it in the plastic casing that it was shipped in, and it has worked out great (just for use at my home). i haven\\'t been very gentle with it at all, and still no scratches. i do like the player now and do not regret that i bought it, the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the touchpad and navigation. amazing player--best in class i have to tell you, i did my research on this one and even had some bad experiences with other players before being completely satisfied with this little versatile player creative came out with. it\\'s got amazing audio fidelity (which is helped by providing earbuds that aren\\'t worthless) and a immpeccable visual display to boot. very clear visual quality. little pixelation, incredibly clear album art shown with song syncs with microsoft outlook (great if you live by to-do lists) picture viewing (zoom and rotation functions) flexibility with software (use with wmp, or two of their very nice little programs) good battery life, short charge time cons: no manual volume control (scroll bar works vertical scroll bar (it\\'s ok, but hard to get used to) the \"pouch\" they give you. i highly recommend buying this over the iriver and especailly the ipod. i like it over the ipod for several reasons... 1. it\\'s not overrated. 2. it beats ipod on performance in almost every review 3. it\\'s more compatible then ipod (i haven\\'t found a media file i couldn\\'t play on there and that includes itunes with a little help with a media program) 4. i like the features better 5. it was cheaper then the ipod of almost the same function ipod is more accessible, but that didn\\'t bother me. i used it for many hours on the plane without a problem and our stuff gets pretty beat up. the kroo case has done awesome protecting my zen. overall, i\\'m in love with it... i have it in my purse all the time to plug in my car or watch my music videos with my friends or just to have something to do in a lull time. the software is easy to use too. creative mediasource is my favorite out of all them. so here are the wonderful things i can do with the vision m that i can\\'t do with my ipod: 1) musicmatch, i finally get to use my beloved musicmatch which i abandoned when i couldn\\'t get it to work with my ipods. 4) listen to music while recharging 5) watch my videos in bold crisp beautiful color, i didn\\'t realize how clunky videos looked on the ipod til i saw them on the vision m. 6) wonderful bass boost, with the vision the sound is so much fuller and deeper than the slightly shiny sounding ipod. now i\\'m not saying this baby is perfect, but its such an improvement from the ipod/itunes world that i just had to give it 5 stars. i\\'m thinking wow factor is fun but overrated... in conclusion, i am a convert and will be using this for all my music needs once the case and skin comes in the mail ;) this baby is geek heaven and us control freaks love it too! i really wanted to like the zen vision m as i like a lot of the features, especially the fm tuner. great features! i thought the features offered were right up my alley including the fm radio, microphone/radio recording capability, access to msn outlook email/calendar features. i must say after opening it and trying it out, it didn\\'t fail to impress! i tried out the microphone to record and found it to be of good quality, the video was sharp enough on the little screen (and my friends were impressed by the video highlights i had of ronaldinho), and the fm radio was able to pick up most of the channels i liked. last but not least, the sound quality is just superb - it is after all creative labs and thats their forte but its still impressive! wow this is fantastic. those have a fantastic picture and sound. great mp3 player greets all i am the former owner of a dell dj and an ipod nano, and i now own a vision m. after using it for a few days i must declare this gadget a masterpiece, i sold my dj on ebay and gave my nano to my sister (darned thing was covered in scratches even though i took great pains to protect it) the screen of the vision is worlds better than any mp3 player out there right now (brighter, much better colors&contrast) a longer battery life (4+ hours), and the wide variety of supported music and video formats will satisfy even the most jaded critic. also, the creative zen vision m: comes with a 1-year warrenty, so if the battery dies, or the screen dies, or the hardware fails within 12 months of purchase, you can get it repaired or replaced. i choose the zen vision over the apple ipod for four main reasons: screen quality, fm stero, recording ability and non-itunes freedom. screen quality: the screen on the zen vision m is better than the apple ipod. music play back is awesome, as good or better than the ipod. i mention it in passing as it kind of goes without saying that the device is great at playing back stored music. notes: the apple video cable that i got for my ibook works with the creative zen vision m:. one that really helped me enjoy the device even more was \"vision:m undocumented how to & tips thread\" google it if ye doubt my word. zen vision m tips & tricks... the zen vision m is waayyy more feature packed than the ipod! i\\'ve had mine since november and i love this thing. this thing even has a programmable shortcut button. a) you can use it as a start/stop record button for the built in microphone, or as one of the many options available. great player...lacking accesorries availability though i\\'ve had this player for the past two weeks and have played around with it extensively. as a video/mp3 player, it\\'s great. long battery life and also easy to navigate through the menus. easy application to use, just drag and drop mp3s like an external hard disk, no itunes necessary. supports album art which is great cause it looks cool when you browse for the album you want to play. package comes with all the necessary items such as a power charger and usb cord and cd full of applications such as video converter, media manager and cd ripper. there isn\\'t many things wrong with the player so you can\\'t really go wrong. but if you compare it with the ipod 30 gig, creative vision : m has better video quality over the ipod, it has a fm tuner for radio and also is a voice recorder, it also plays multiple formats such as divx and xvid which is great for lunch time watching (i don\\'t think either ipod or creative vision : m was meant for movie watching). battery life is the same as it uses the same battery, although creative seems to have better power saving functions. overall a highly recommended system and a must have for people who want music on the go. ), supports a plethora more file types ( and there is no *sound* reason to favor apple\\'s format over others, it actually is less desireable because of sheer device compliance restrictions). in addition to that, for people who have tivo on their computer or in the standard format, the creative accepts tivo on the go ( whatever that is), but for me, the video capabilities of this player allow me to circumvent approximately 2 hrs. the screen displays roughly 200,000 more colors than the apple and the interface is something you will get past in about 1 week. i like it better than the wheel almost now. i\\'ve had the player for a few weeks now and have used all the features available. the screen is great the color is outstanding , the sound is as any creative player,simply amazing and the custom eq feature is a big plus. radio frequency comes in very clear with little interference and i work in nyc midtown with lots of tall buildings. all in all it\\'s a great little package, since i got my zen a few co-workers have put there pod\\'s on ebay and are getting the zen , more bang for your buck with 1 simple piece of equipment. i have a case and screen protector that i purchased from www.i-nique.com that works like a gem. i am very happy with this player good grief simply put, this device is amazing. and still, when i got my hands on the zen visoin m, i was amazed at the picture quality, radio performance, ease of use, sound quality, album art display...good grief....it is just an amazing product. yes, there are minor annoyances (such as black version collects fingerprints like crazy), but overall it is well worth your money. 95% of you will be super satisfied with this product. best mp3 player!! with the vision m you get a longer battery life than the ipod both in music and video, you have a wider variety of music and video formats that can be used with this player and you also get superior audio from this player. the vision m also has an fm tuner which also allows you to record straight from radio to mp3 format so if you hear a song you love on the radio you can simply record it and have it stored for later listening. this player also has a voice recorder, calendar which can be synced with your pc and something that is a big plus is the vision m allows you to customize your own wallpaper for your player and you can even use your own pictures as the screen savers something no other player allows you to do. the one thing that truly stands out aside from all those features is also the fact that this player has such an outstanding screen and it must been seen in person to believe as opposed to the ipod this player displays 262,00 colors to the ipods 65,000. video playback is very smooth with no frame rate lose whatsoever and even if you get this purely for music, once you see the screen and the video playback this player will make you want to watch videos on it no doubt about it. the vision m is very simple to use and the software makes transferring music, movies and pictures so simple its as easy as dragging and dropping which unlike the ipod requires you to use itunes and as a consumer who purchases products at my own cost i want to be able to use my player as i like without having restrictions that i am bound to. the music play back on this player is superb and displays album art, artist info, artist track and you also have the ability to customize your own playlists, album of the day, rarely played and most played, ect. the vision m comes in 5 colors and all look great, but just like the black ipod the black vision m can scratch easier than the other colors so a case would be highly recommended, but then again with all things if you take care of your \"toys\" scratches can be avoided. i would also recommend a different pair of headphones as the ones included with the player sound great, but for true audio heads they won\\'t be enough for your listening pleasure, but that is with any mp3 player new headphones are always a must. the vision m is still brand new to the market so accessories are limited right now, but rest assured that as the market starts catching wind of this quickly sought after player, creative will start pushing accessories just like apple does and we will all be overwhelmed with the wealth of accessories. i truly don\\'t have any cons against this player as it has far exceeded my expectations and if you are in the market for a new mp3 player and are debating between the ipod and this player, make no mistake you will be happy with either one, but why settle for what is the rule of thumb and go with what everyone else on the block owns and buy the vision m and be the exception to this thing is fantastic. i\\'ve got the hang of it and i\\'m impressed. zen pros 14 hr battery life, 10 hrs voice recording (very nice for putting comments or stories on cd\\'s), awesome music management software (not exclusive to one format), (if style is an issue) 5 colors to choose from, video playback is awesome (also a pantload of formats for compatibilities sake), theinvisibleshield.com offers a film that\\'s just unreal to protect the screen (ipod too) i say dodge the ipod like the plague(sp?) creative\\'s track record is pretty good too. i love this device i just got the creative zen vision for my b-day. i love the sound quality. some people have complained about the earphones, but unless they\\'re actually losing their hearing, they are great. the sound is crisp and clear. i swear the videos are clearer and brighter and crispier looking than even on my notebook that i\\'ve had for just over a year. i love it and can\\'t wait to play around with the other features. i highly and fully recommend this over the ipod. thoroughly impressed in my opinion; creative audio/video players are the best on the market in terms of value, performance, and features. what first impressed me with the vision m was the quality of the screen; it is very bright, the abundance of colors is amazing and the backround customization is great. the best thing i like about this player is the fact that it supports a large array of video/audio formats. i was able to transfer my video and music files easily.in regards to performance, the playback was perfect. i was able to watch a full length video and still have plenty of juice left to listen to music. the sound quality of the music was very impressive, (97 db snr), add to the fact that you can use custom eq to tweak it to your liking. the only drawback with this device is the screeen scratches easily, but as one reviewer pointed out, you can use pda screen protectors to preserve the screens finish.other than this; the player is perfect. if you\\'re looking for a product that will play your music and video files flawlessy and more, then this is the player for you. it is a better choice than the ipod and your dollars will go a lot furthur with this investment. the ultimate mp3/divx/fm radio player i love my vision:m. the interface is intuitive and the video quality is amazing. when i use the optional av cable to stream divx files to the tv, they are even better than vhs quality. being able to listen to, as well as record, fm radio is a fabulous bonus, as is the voice recorder. a psp ac adapter works with this unit and i picked one up for $10 at the real canadian superstore, so i can recharge the player without having to hook it up to a computer. i\\'m extremely happy with my purchase! truly a feature loaded player that\\'s well worth the investment! this is truly a feature packed mp3 player that\\'s simple to use for anyone, and offers plenty of goodies for your money. the creative zen vision m takes the personal music player to another level by expanding on the basics of an ipod photo and gives you so much more freedom then you thought was possible. the buttons are located in easy to use areas and the backlights are vibrant and have a soft \"click\" when pressed. the screen is incredible! the color is bright and crisp and truly makes other named mp3 players look black and white! the unit includes a usb 2.0 cable, a/c adapter (yes, ipod users, you heard that right... it doesn\\'t cost more), software, headphones (that acutally sound halfway decent), and a carry pouch. you can purchase some great accesories including a/v cables, leather case, dock, wired remote, and other goodies. setup is a breeze with this player, installing the drivers and software was real simple. the included software is feature loaded with video compression software, mp3 encoding, photo management, and other goodies. transfering music is as easy as dragging and dropping as is importing photos and downloading movies to the player. another great feature with this unit is the \"plays for sure\" technology. this player is compatable with many of your music membership services like napster, rhapsody, or (my personal choice) virgin digital (best price per month). you can even listen to your favorite radio station (news, talk shows, music) and college students will love the built in voice recorder for classes and organizing those recordings is a snap on your computer! audiophiles will love the sound quality and the features to tweek the sound to your liking. this player is truly the best kept secret in a world that\\'s seemingly dominated by a carefully marketed toy that scratches if you breath on it. if you\\'re looking for the real deal, with flexability, and is truly feature loaded then look no further! creative has a real winner on their hands! they\\'re marketing people are brilliant! with the creative i don\\'t have to worry about converting anything. i already have so much music on my windows media centers and copying those over to the zen was a breeze. the included software even converts video for you if in the wrong format. it\\'s truely plug and play and works great! 300 bones isn\\'t a small purchase for me so i am thrilled to be so happy with this product. feature rich and the sound is great! i would recommend this as the very best alternative to the ipod. outstanding.. the best in market.. pros: music, videos and photos run with extreme clarity and sound. video playback in high definition. awesome build quality, attractive interface, supports almost every format on earth. first thing u\\'ll notice when you open the box is its elegent and beautiful built quality.. then when you charge it up and start, you cannot resist shouting out a \"waoooow\", looking at its high definition screen.. its simply awesome.. i like the fact that creative had pre-loaded a lot of videos and photos so that that you could right away experience the excellent quality of the device.. i ran through a few of the preloaded videos and photos. the video qualityis beyond words.. the sound is crystal clear.. i trid to pump up the volumn to test for any noise.. but could\\'nt find any till it hit the 21 mark on the volumn. the options are great.. you can rate your songs while hearing them and the dj option allows you to play the most favourite and also rarely heard songs also, so you dont forget any song in your 10gb or so song chest!! the manual equalizer and the presets are really good. i got it for $16 online and helps you a lot while travelling and saves a lot of time. all said, the experience is really great, and i feel proud to own it. you will never be diappointed with it, infact you\\'ll feel really proud to possess it.. i highly recommend it to anybody who plans to go for a hard drive player with video.. a very good job by creative. p.s... a well deserved victory for the zvm at ces 2006.. \"best in mp3 and portable devices\" category and also a \"best in show award\".. some of the good things are: it has a huge capacity for quite a number of songs and pictures, it has voice recorder, it\\'s gorgeous looking, very bright screen when you put it to 100% brightness, fm radio which you can record from and save it on your player, decent size... it\\'s not too big and not too small... it\\'s definitely bigger then the ipod video, but i like the feel of it, once you get used to it, the buttons and scroll is pretty simply to operate, the sound quality is great and there are 25 levels to choose from... and the list goes on. they look nice, and everything\\'s geared towards them because they\\'ve the majority of the marketshare. accessories are good--though at apple\\'s high prices--and itunes is a great player that gives access to all kinds of downloads. they worked hard and gave it several features ipods can\\'t offer, such as a fm player that gives you 32 preset slots, and the option to record off of it. it\\'s battery life is also longer by a few hours. it works with more formats for music and video, and you don\\'t need a certain program to load music (like how ipods need itunes.) it is a little thicker, but i find that it fits in my hand better. and it is a better product, too...in fact, it won overall best at the 2006 consumer electronics show. itunes is great for getting things on your ipod. still, over all i am happy that i have a zen--it is a better product. first of all, while it is a bit thicker than an ipod, it fits very nicely in your hand (its pretty close to the size of a deck of cards). the screen is brilliant; much brighter and more vibrant than my girlfriends ipod and the sound quality is well above average. pictures looked excellent, especially with the zoom function and movies were of very good quality as well considering the 2 1/2 inch screen. it was very easy to adjust to the controls and buttons of the player. everything is very intuitive and the vertical touchpad is very easy to use. after a day of use i had next to no instances where i would accidentally hit a button. getting music on to the player was a breeze. as for my new cds and such, i like the ability to use any ripping device on the computer. as a student, the removable disk aspect of the zen is major plus. also i was pleased with the ability to be able to create playlists directly on the player without having to use a computer. the radio feature is very good, providing reception equivalent to my car in most cases (i guess this could be seen as a novelty to some, but i have a morning show that i am strongly attached to and now i can listen to it from anywhere.) the included case is decent for protecting it yet it is admittedly ugly and there is sadly an absence of alternatives. overall, i would -strongly- recommend the creative zen vision:m to anyone who asked. the ease of use is incredible and the features blow the ipod out of the water. fantastic product. here are my observations about the zen vision:m 30gb positive + it probably is better than the video ipod overall. it has twice the video battery rating, and it supports many more video and song formats than the ipod. also, it is windows sureplay compatible, so just about any online mp3 store\\'s files will work on this thing. + it supports many video types including my home mpeg2 and avi videos from my home movies. + excellent customer support at creative. overall, its a good product and i have no regrets. very versatile-- my 10 year old son wanted an ipod video but then he did some comparisons and surprisingly he chose creative zen vision: m. after using zen vision: m for few days, i think he has made a right choice. here are certain plus points of creative zen vision: m. ** it comes with an adapter! ** vision m: works as a true usb flash drive with upto 10gb plus capacity. ** you have a nice fm tuner built in so i don\\'t have to worry about paying too much for songs. ** there are multiple ways to move media/files to vision m. being windows user, it is pretty intuitive to work with vision m ** i think vision m is little bulkier but i think that is the right size that fits well in your hand. the control buttons are also comfortable to work with. it would not cost them more than $2 per piece! in short, this is a preety good hand-held media player. much better than my ipod i originally bought an ipod video 30gb. i love the interface. i love the fact that i can use explorer to copy directly to the player. making playlists is much easier on the m30 as well. the software is very user friendly and the learning curve is short. this is a much better player and gives all the freedom to the user to choose what services to are best for downloading music and videos. i give 5 stars to the zen m30. after lugging the vision: m around for a week, i did not find it to be uncomfortable to hold in the hand or heavy at all. it slips comfortably into any pocket. i opted for the black because it looked the sleekest and classiest. creative took the initiative to include a wall charger in their package, which is always welcome. the difference in the amounts of colors that each player displays is breath-taking. the pictures and video positively pop out of the screen, though some pictures are over saturated. it makes ordinary photos look brilliant and professional on its screen. one feature i thoroughly enjoyed was the ability to pick any picture and set it as a wallpaper. the vision even lets you change the brightness of the picture and add effects such as black and white and sepia to the photo before applying it as a wallpaper. pretty nifty. i\\'ll pass because i found that the a/v cable for my father\\'s camcorder works ok. sure it only plays audio in mono but hey, it works and it\\'s free. one reason why the ipod is such a popular seller is because of the seamless integration with itunes. everything is simplified into one program and opens the user to a world of content. the itunes store is simple and beautiful and has been the one defining choice among some users to choose an ipod. purchasing tracks on urge is simple because it only asks you for your credit card number once and you can purchase million of songs with a click. one feature i really enjoy about urge is way they organize their content in easy to access playlists and charts. the pros: best screen quality for videos- has something like 265,000 colours while the ipod has 64,000. also you can change between 6 different backgrounds, which is a small but yet cool feature. long battery life- i used to charge my ipod every night but with the zen i only charge for two and a half hours every two or three days, which is great if i forget to charge it one night i dont really have to worry about \"is it going to die on me\" factor. by the way its amazing because you can plug it in for around 45 minutes to charge and its halfway full when you pull it out. controls- i peronally love the layout of the buttons and ill exlplain them to you too. programs- i use window media player to transfer songs, which is basically like a more advanced version of itunes, and its pretty easy to get used to. sound- better than the ipods in my opinion. it feels comfortable in your hand. the front is pretty scratch worthy, but not too bad. i ordered an invisible shield from www.shieldzone.com and i could rub a coin all over it and just wipe it off and it looks brand new. the best part is you dont need to worry about the back getting scratched up because its like a sand blasted back. on the back the zen logo is indented with a ripple effect which adds some nice touch. all in all the zen is a great produc, and in my opinion kills the ipod video. just wanted to let you guys know how much i love this little gadget the fact it doesn\\'t have to come from the itunes store or some other proprietary format is a huge plus. \"super\" is a great little free program. music playback sounds great. has eq settings preprogramed, and custom. the included earphones seem fine. the interface is also quite customizable, allowing you to add or delete menu items, and change wall papers. there is also a custom shortcut button which is really handy. the picture quality is superb. the size is very watchable. this is the best portable media player out as of yet. it caters to more files, and doesn\\'t try to play \\'big brother\\' and be your conscience by limiting what you can and cannot download and transfer between the unit and your other pcs. so, it has the speed, look and feel of an ipod, is compatable with more file types for both audio and video, and it won\\'t try to be your moral guide by limiting what you can transfer and what type of file. 1)the color screen is simply amazing. 4)battery life. 5)the shortcut button is an excellent idea. i\\'ve had it for a few months now and i have to say that it is a great little device. the controls really are intuitive and if they aren\\'t then i can\\'t imagine that they\\'d take long for you to get used to. all other controls are great and it has a neat button to send you straight to random all play of your whole library or you can change the button to jump straight to several different uses. the interface for adding to the player is very simple. adding songs is easy and it groups them well as long as you make sure the tracks are labled properly. the display is amazing. no joke, way better than ipod. it also has a pretty large screen for a good viewing area. i bought one and sure enough it worked like a charm. they\\'re also cheaper than creative\\'s and you can buy them at best buy. luckily it\\'s easy to navigate to the sound area that has several different eq settings to choose from. another plus is you can use a portion of the device as a removable storage device. the sony street style phones are in no way top of the line; however, they\\'re cheap, they sound pretty good, and they\\'ll last you forever. it also has fm radio which is a huge plus. it gets great reception. very crisp and clear and easy to make presets. the microphone that records sound is actually really good. so overall this is a great player with just a few flaws. but, the zen is miraculous! fm reception is very good (blows my sony hifi component tuner away, way away), battery life excellent. at first--they took a bit to figure out since the manual was so sparse, but once you know how to use, controls are superb (the volume etc are very intuitive). the hole zen operation is near identical to a laptop touch pad with tapping, then you get audible confirmation with each selection. the music sounds great, the unit looks sharp, and the functions are seemingly endless. zen is not just a fancy cd player as ipod really is, and it comes with everything you need. absolutely the right choice for me, i won\\'t own another ipod. btw, bought theinvisibleshield.com\\'s translucent protective covering ($15) for my zen, a pain to apply correctly, but it is indestructible and clear as a bell when you get it right--forget the need of any type of case, etc. the zen vision m is one of those best products in the mp3 field. i was looking for a small mp3 player with a descent storage and of course it must be good looking. the e260 gives you that very cheap look although it costs me 220 usd. i started comparing between the 2 most rivals in the market, the ipod video and the zen vision m. finally, i decided to buy the vision m for the reasons below: 1-the vision m is equipped with an fm tuner with a perfect reception for 70% of the channels. 2-the vision m is equipped with an fm recorder so you can record your favorite radio show, song or game and listen to it later. 3-the vision m is equipped with an excellent voice recorder. i made a test for the voice recorder in best buy, i recorded my voice talking in the middle of a crowd and wow i can still hear my voice clearly 4-the 2.5 inch lcd(high definition)screen is very clear and sharp that you can see your pictures very vivid plus, you have a zoom in feature. 5-the player is customizable. plus, the player comes equipped with 6 different backgrounds and fonts. 6-the vision m is not scratches and fingerprints magnet like the ipods. 7-the included software is very easy to use. 9-sound quality is pretty much the same, but the included speakers with the creative are prettier than the ipod. 11-the vision m has better battery life, lasts 1 - 1.5 hours more than the ipod video when playing videos and more hours when you play music 12-the vision m has one of the best features that ever came in an mp3 player before..you can search for your song alphabetically. plus, you can click on the vertical touch pad and a keyboard will apears on which type the name of your song using the touch pad and the player will look it up for you whereever this song exists. conclusion: the vision m offers you all the ipod video features plus the list above. feel this one and try it anywhere and you will find very easy to use and even easier. the back of the sansa is made of liquid metal which was designed to resist scratches which i like, but what i don\\'t like is that this back and the whole player gives you that feeling that the player is cheap and cery cheap but of course i agree that the sansa e200 has much better value that ipod nano.. regarding the accessories i placed an order for an awesome silicone case from dlo.com and i received it yesterday.. the case fits my vision m perfectly and i got the case on time wih no hassles. vision m is a winner i got the zen vision m from amazon last week. the screen is beautiful, video quality is amazing. it is considerably thicker than the 30g ipod video, but it feels much more solid and is more comfortable to hold in your hand. battery life is great (charger included!) you can drag and drop mp3, wma, avi, divx, almost any audio or video file you may have and this will play it (or use the included software if you prefer). the user interface is great, much better than ipod\\'s in my opinion. other benefits are the fm radio and voice recorder. i tried the voice recorder and the quality was excellent, no spinning hard drive noise. they\\'ve made improvements over the zen touch. the buttons on the front are better, the navigation is better, and the usb cable charges the thing as well, the external power supply isn\\'t required (although it is supplied!). it\\'s very stylish, solid, good looking machine. the vision also has a screen with more colors and brighter images. it just looks better. but most of all, the great thing about the vision is the fact that i don\\'t have to use itunes. the ipod and itunes are a great combination for those who aren\\'t the most computer saavy. but the vision works with creative\\'s itunes equivilent just fine, in addition to windows media player 10, in addition to the windows file system directly, akin to a mass storage device. i love the thing, although i\\'m still kinda getting used to it. great sound and video... ok first let me say i got this yesterday, i am a techno junkie and wanted something to watch photoshop tv videos on. but, and that is a big but...... i was not disappointed when i got all that work done. the zen is amazing. the quality of the movies is stunning. it is like watching hdtv, crystal clear and the sound is marvelous. so for all the work i have to go through to get my videos over, i am sooooo glad i bought this instead of the ipod. i gave this 4 stars because of the software headaches, but other than that, this is a marvelous piece of equipment! i have had this device since february and it is great. the video quality is great. the mp3 player is great. works like a top for any podcast or video cast as well as most any type of music file (real, mp3, wma, etc.) creative makes great sound cards for your pc, why not a great mp3 player. i haven\\'t had to test the battery life much. with the included wall charger/adapter, you can keep it powered on all day and not rely solely on usb charging/connection (which it also supports.) the radio gets great reception. the recording capability is a nice bonus. it has saved me a great deal of time in staff meetings - being able to capture important conversations and retrieve them easily later is quite nifty. scanning the web, there is ample online support for most any issue you might have. with four months of daily use under my belt, i haven\\'t had any issues. the quality and feel of the creative zen video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. you can record directly from the integrated fm radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. zen vision:m supports many video formats, such as divx? the battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. if you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. it has a really great design, and it\\'s easy to navigate with no experience. the zen vision is a bit clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works great. it\\'s probably just as easy to use as the ipod, plus as others have stated, that\\'s less buttons to wear out. another thing i think this player has over the ipod is that there is no real need for extra software. i got a warning that said the file type is not supported, but when i used the software that came with my player (very clean and easy interface, by the way), it worked fine. features after having this device for about a week, i really can\\'t think of anything else i could want. it plays pretty much every video i throw at it (mpeg, xvid, divx 4 & 5, motion jpeg, windows media video 9), besides quicktime and real media. the screen is 2.5\" and supports 262,144 colors. that\\'s way better than any ipod video. it also has a video output, so i can hook it up to my plasma screen at home and watch the episodes of the office that i downloaded. it has six different themes to choose from, all look very nice depending on your taste in color. also, the menu system is customizable. pros - supports many video and audio codecs. - fm tuner - voice recorder (you can also record fm streams) - extremely customizable - plug-and-play setup - video output cons - no support for quicktime and realmedia - no ogg or acc support - included headset is terrible - desktop dock sold separately conclusion all in all, this player really beats the ipod on all levels. add to the fact that creative\\'s screen is more vivid and bright - 262,144 color screen compared to ipod video\\'s 65,000 color screen. the creative vision m is an ipod killer - true in terms of features and value. with that 30$ you get: a much more advanced display. you get longer battery life for video. also 640x480 resolution is supported by the vision m unlike ipod video which is limited to 320 x 240 resolution. the higher resolution allows the tv output to be much more clearer. you get more audio format support, fm radio, voice recording etc. excellent player this is by far the best of the players that i have used. the vision just plain looks better and you can clearly see more detail even if you take the same video or movie and put it in both players. the vision also plays a variety of different video and audio formats including divx and wmv. it is a little thicker but still looks awesome i have the black and it turns heads wherever i go. this is a great player to set up in you car especially if you have an in dash dvd player you can just use an av cable and you\\'re all set. another great feature of this player is the fm radio built in. the battery life is great. not bad at all. its a breeze to transfer your music or movie collection to the vision and you don\\'t even have to install any software. i highly recommend it to anyone that wants a versatile player that can be used with so many different formats as well as many different online music stores so not everyone has to be a slave to itunes because in my opinion their content is not any better than the others. summary: the creative zen vision:m is a multi-award-winning mp3 player for good reason. overall, the creative zen vision:m is a better product than anything else on the market. the interface: the interface of the vision:m is extremely ergonomic and easy to use. the touchpad\\'s sensitivity is easily adjusted and comfortable to navigate through any menu. in addition, all the menus are fully customizable so you can maximize your own browsing preferences. the performance: the vision:m\\'s screen is incredible. in addition, the battery life when playing video is up to four times that of the ipod, meaning you can watch feature-length films without charging, and still have enough battery life for hours of music. the sound quality is also supurb - something you can expect from a company that specializes in digital audio equipment (chances are the sound card in your computer was made by creative). the features: in addition to the features offered by the ipod video, the vision:m offers a radio am/fm tuner and a radio/voice recorder. while these may not sound that useful, i\\'ve used them more than i thought i would, especially the voice recorder. another incredible feature the vision:m offers over the ipod is complete compatibility and integration with windows. unlike the ipod, the vision:m offers support for a large library of filetypes - where the ipod only supports its own formats and has to reformat your files to make them compatible, the vision:m rarely (if ever) has to do so - even xvid/divx formats will play! the quick review: pros: ample battery life clear, bright, colorful display customizable menus ergonomic interface comes in five colors excellent sound quality same price as ipod cons: slightly thicker than the ipod not mac compatible only comes in 30gb - ipod offers a 60gb model few accessories (can find more on ebay, ship from overseas) the bottom line: the ipod comes with a huge culture identification behind it that the vision:m just doesn\\'t have, so if you\\'re looking to be a part of that culture regardless of the quality of the product, there\\'s no reason not to buy the ipod. it\\'s still a good product. but if what you\\'re looking for is a high quality, affordable media player that won\\'t let you down and will consistently outperform the competition, the vision:m is your best choice. amazing...truly amazing ive been in the process of buying a mp3 player and spent countless hours researching the best of the best, trying to get the biggest bang for the buck...look no further.. the creative zen vision: m has a 30gb hard drive thats able to store up to \"15,000 songs\", \"120 hours of video\", and \"tens of thousands of photos\". it also has a fm radio (with the ability to record songs off the radio), a calender, contact list, and task menu (of which all can be synched with microsoft outlook). the ipod people are getting scared...lol.. anyway, i got mine and have had it for a week and it works perfect! no freezing, no glitches, perfect sound quality, the easiest, most user-friendly software ever, a great scroll pad for selecting music! ok, now here\\'s the real meat of this review: the great things the creative zen vision: m has- 1. great battery life 2. a multitude of colors (262,144 vivid colors ), making images clearer and sharper 3. 4. fm radio...a nice plus for those random moods 5. fm radio recorder 6. can store videos and photos in addition to the music 7. can create playlists and slideshows using the awesome creative zen mdeia explorer 8. media can easily be dragged and dropped into player 9. can buy an av cable to hook up to tv to play videos and slideshows 10. voice recorder 11. calender and such 12. scroll button (the controls in general) 13. price...ipod-299.99 creative zen vision: m- 268.99 obvious choice? i bought the zen vision:m about a week ago, and i have been amazed by it since it\\'s been in my possession. i find the size to be just right for this device, very comparable to the 20 gb ipod i have owned for the last few years. it\\'s a solid piece of equipment (scratches easy, don\\'t even mess around just buy a case for it. the menu interface is quite reminiscent of the ipod\\'s (which is a good thing), with a few excellent updates. it has a feature while browsing the media library that enables you to scroll to a specific letter rather than scroll through everything...very handy for large libraries. the touchpad that for some reason people are complaining about in their reviews has given me no trouble. it functions almost exactly the same, except it has a rapid scroll function which comes in handy. it has three sensitivity settings, so there is really no reason to complain about its sensitivity. it\\'s awesome. i find it playing back videos at exactly the quality they should be, colors are right on. no fuzziness or lines in the video. the zen vision:m is compatible with just about every music service there is...ipods don\\'t have a chance with anything besides itunes. not to mention the zen is compatible with just about every media file you could want to put on your mp3 player. i still wish i could play them through winamp though... if you want an mp3 player, stop what youre doing and buy this one now. truly an amazing gadget! here you go: pros: beautiful and bright screen (displays thousands of more colors than the ipod video by the way). even at 50% brightness (which is default setting out of the box) it looks bright! ability to customize most of the features. this includes being able to set your own photos for the wallpaper, custom equilizer, custom brightnes setting, custom shortcut button, organization of folders(audio, photo, video folders)...etc. great sound! good user interface: the thumb scroller interface takes a few days to get used to, then it\\'s pretty user friendly. ability to play lots of different video files like divx and mpg4. the screen is perfect for watching cartoons and anime on. good size. it\\'s actually the perfect size and feels great in your hand. still pocketable and still feels rock solid and not fragile. these are the only reasons why i gave this player 4 out of 5 stars. all in all this player really rocks and is worth every penny! very good portable media player for those of you looking to read something with substance, here\\'s a review from someone who actually owns both an ipod and zen vision m and has used the ipod video. i already own a regular 4g ipod and loved it. the clickwheel made using it so easy. for a reputable site to recommends this as best in show over the hundreds of other new devices says a lot. ok, on to the real review..... i purchased the black vision m and the two things that stand out is the clean front layout and thickness. although i would prefer the slim shape of the ipod, the thicker vision m was fine as it still fits in my pocket comfortably and is quite snug in my hand. you are able to very quickly scan though large song lists by holding down at the top or bottom of the touchpad. the headset that comes with the vision is slightly better than the average as they fit snug in your ear and have good response. in my opinion, both the sound quality of the ipod and vision m are good, but the vision m is slightly better. additionally you can enhance your listening experience with the built in preset or custom equalizer and bass boost options. other info radio: very very good. your headphones is used as the antenna and the reception is very good. you are able to preset up to 32 stations (including renaming them) manually or thought the auto seek option. you also have a signal strength bar (similar to ones found on cellphones) video: the player\\'s codec supports divx4/5, xvid5, mpeg-1/2/4sp, and wmv9 as well as motion-jpeg. screen: excellent, the 2.5\" screen is bright and the colors are vivid; it\\'s capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors. easily better than the ipod video which i thought was good to begin with. pictures: the viewer allows you to choose from specified folder and displays contents in a 5 x 4 format. again, colors are vivid and you can even get picture details (via context button). miscellaneous features: voice recording, custom wallpaper, sync your outlook calendar option, button lock (disables the touchpad and buttons), song and picture rating, play music while viewing pictures, compatible with windows media player 10, 6 hours of video battery life, smart playlists (higher rated songs play back more frequently i think), smart volume (normalizes volume of all songs), video out, power saving options, and playsforsure compatibility. in summary, if you just need a decent mp3 player with video and photo capabilities, then the ipod is a fine choice. for those searching for a more feature rich player, this is an excellent option. this item is selling well and i hope that translates to more accessories for this wonderful player. i have thoroughly enjoyed using this player and hope you find this review informative. -plays divx and xvid video, as well as wmv-9 and mpeg1/2/4. -higher color screen (262,144 colors vs 65,000 colors) -natively plays mp3, wma and wav, without conversion. -better signal-to-noise ratio under same frequency response. -longer battery life (approx 4 hours video playback vs ipod\\'s 2 hours) -includes ac charger. -voice recorder. -compatible with popular music services, like napster. -customizable menu, with background image. -organizer features outlook sync support; contacts, calendar & tasks. -the back side isn\\'t made out of scratch magnets like the ipod. -slimmer. -lots of first and third party accessories available. -itunes support. it\\'s a little thicker than the ipod, but i actually like how it feels in my hand better (imho). the screen is beautiful, the file formats that are supported are great, the integration with wmp10 and the on-line stores is certainly better than the ipod. i just love it. if you love the ipod\\'s great. again, i like them too, but right now i would pick this player. this fm radio works fine. it doesn\\'t take any more space and it\\'s nice on rare occasion. there is a reason why this little player just won the overall best of the 2006 consumer electronics show (ces). truly amazing gadget! here you go: pros: beautiful and bright screen (displays thousands of more colors than the ipod video by the way). even at 50% brightness (which is default setting out of the box) it looks bright! ability to customize most of the features. this includes being able to set

(...) i'm not sure if we got a bad unit, but the remote control only works 1/3 of the time. the mirror also scratches pretty easy. my only complaint is that you have to position the remote just right to turn it on. but it doesn't install well. the musical selections are less than wonderful, and the arrangements are awful! however, consistent with other reviews, the remote control does not work half of the time and it eats up batteries. also, i have found that the remote will not work if it gets cold. sometimes the remote is left behind & i have no way to turn the mirror on. 1. the mirror scratches very easily, just try and breath on it and wipe. 6. even with fresh batteries the volume goes from nonexistant to a something you can hear...but nothing in between. i brought the 1st one back b/c the remote stopped working after the 1st week. not very durable or safe i bought the mirror when my son was 3 weeks old and he now 3 months old so needless to say it has only lasted 2 1/2 months before the strap that holds it in place snapped. the remote doesn't work very well either. i am normally happy with fisher price products but this one was made very poorly. the remote doesn't work all the time and it does shift in the car. remote didnt work and the music was grainy beware... i bought one of these from amazon... the lights and music didn't work. it takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around. the only downfall is the remote doesn't turn the mirror off. it would be 5 stars but the mirror quit working all together after about 2 months from the first time i used it. mirror scratches easily! doesn't work in middle seat upon installing our car seat in the middle seat in the back, as directed, we found we absolutely could not get this mirror to stay with only using the clamp as it states in the directions. there was nothing to connect the hook and strap onto on either of our cars and we are extremely disappointed. the visor clip on the back of the remote is way to slim. second the clip broke on the remote when we put it on the visor. the lights are only really visible at night, the music is not even something that would be nice for a baby. it also doesn't fit on the headrest of my car very well, the velcrow isn't long enough. the remote for it also did not work all the time and even when i tried to explore all the settings with out the remote the toy had a mind of it's own. not fit for an suv my wife and i have two suvs and the car seat is installed in the middle seat. the problem with this mirror is that it does not stay in place. the bendable mounting bracket is not helpful as it does not grip the seat very well because each time the vehicle moves forward, the mirror would fall off (backwards). i bought this toy for our baby and have discovered some major design flaws - the biggest being unable to turn this toy on (at all) without the remote!!! and finally, it does not position well for baby to see into. also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor. not the most exciting but useful........... this toy was great to start but it sucks the life of the batteries. also its not bright enough at night to see the face of your child if your checking on them in the back seat. one, the remote is large and the clip doesnt attach to the visor. the product rates one star only because i couldn't give it zero. the lights did not work one first one we bought. my only problem is that the remote works to turn it on but the remote will not turn it off. yes, the music was annoying to anyone over the age of 2; yes, you could only see the lights at night; and yes, the remote was a pain. no matter how many ways we try to attach it it's just not stable. :) cons: - the size can be a negative because it does obstruct the view out my back window quite a bit.\""

              "'the headset paired with my desktop ok, it was recognized and seemed to install correctly. great buy i will be on the beaches of fla for 2 weeks in july and these headphones are gonna work out perfect. great price too! but in general they work well, and very importantly, they are comfortable (for me, anyway). everything went smoothly with the jabra bt620s setup, they are comfortable to wear, although i wish it had 2 more clicks up on the volume. great head set the head set works well with my samsung phone. i got a great price and the item arrived quickly. decent but goofy looking, work well with blackberry pearl pros: - easy pairing with blackberry pearl - good stereo sound, no crackling or interruptions - excellent for jogging, headphones are tight and band over the ears holds them in place very well when running, doing situps, etc. cons: - big and goofy looking, another reviewer said they make you look like princess leia which is very accurate, plus the nerdy blue lights that can be turned off but have to be turned off again after recharging - decent volume but would like to be able to make it a couple notches louder in the gym - annoying beeps when increasing or decreasing volume i\\'m not a serious audiophile but i know the different between good and cruddy sound, and these headphones are pretty good with the blackberry pearl. i\\'ve been happy with these headphones after a couple of weeks, they stay on well when jogging and the sound is pretty good, which were the main reasons i wanted them. clarity of call was great. overall: jabra bt is very comfortable (fits very well on my head (ears) and it\\'s not as heavy as other bt headphones), stream calls with perfect sound, it have sensitive buttons so be carefull while you putting them down to not make extra phone call)...;) this is a good product this is a good functional product but the audio quality for music is not too good but the battery life is excellent. i am happy with the product. great this is a great product! it fits on the ears comfortably, it\\'s kind big on \\'em though. but the sound quality is great, and the lighting is a plus (blue blinking lights amuse me) i can use my phone and my ipod nano with this (need to buy a music adapter for ipod usage with this product) and depending on the phone you can use it bluetooth and accept incoming calls while listening to music, just press the left side button and your music will pause and the phone call will be active. aside from that, on my perspective the sound is good, the microphone works very well, the battery charge is good, volume and other buttons work properly. sound is pretty good, but certainly can\\'t overcome the discomfort. very good headset! then, i tried my blackberry and my laptop (hp pavilion dv2320us) and a belkin bluetooth adapter... sound quality really good!!! obviously the headset is not totally perfect, it is suitable to radio interference, but works fine and sound very good!... good range with the bluetooth and they sound great in the full stereo mode. great headset at a great price this is my first bt stereo headset so i won\\'t be able to compare it with another one. first of all i am very happy with these. to sum up, i can use all the features with my atom exec and ausus f5rl with a very good music quality for cheap. works as promised it works well. which means i can\\'t lay down, or lean the side of my head on anything, or even turn 90degress in a high backed chair (car) audio quality is great. construction is sound. works great in the car; does not do all it says it will the headset can connect to a pc and a mobile under very specific conditions. excellent bluetooth headphones simple. simple to set up, simple to use. sound quality is very good. no entangling cables, great sound, long battery life and a comfortable, secure fit. great product for the price! i really like this product, i found it had a lot more features that i didn\\'t know were even possible. i like to keep reviews fairly short, so here are my good points: -awesome deep and full sound -long life between charges -controls for music and volume right on the headset. -awesome range, sometimes i forgot where my phone was and kept on jammin. -no lock button, the headphones are easy to turn on with a push of the side buttons that can often get tapped in a backpack. i personally find the headphones themselves very comfortable, and i like the \\'back of the head\\' style. good headset pros: wireless good battery life (16 hours music / 14 talk) switchs between calls and music easily change tracks easily very cheap cons: music is a little loud when listening in a quiet place little bit uncomfortable to wear during long periods of time everyone stop complaining about the blue lights they can be turned off read the manual. works well, but a bit heavy i purchased this with the jabra music adaptor and they work well together. the sound quality is very good, decent bass, much better than lightweight headphones. i am impressed by the battery life and they work very well as a headset for my cell phone. works good but to bulky i like the performance and sound quality of this headset. thise headset worked perfectly with both devices. now after some use it works good. the sound is surprisingly good although not that loud...you certainly will not blow out your eardrums with these. the range and clarity was excellent. a nice product once it was installed correctly although the pairing and on/off controls on the headset are a little confusing and dont respond as well as you would expect. the pair installs quickly and easily on an xp machine. the sound is surprisingly good. the range and clarity is outstanding! (price was a strong influence) the jabra bt620s is really nice. i am very happy with them. the sound is great. i love this product. nice i really like this headset, the batteries last along time and they rarely cut out. excellent fun but not brainfree these headphones, for the price, are a good deal that i would recommend to others. here\\'s the support page http://www.jabra.com/sites/jabra/na-us/support/pages/jabrabt620s.aspx this headset paired easiest with my phone, an lg vx8300, and the sound quality was, to my ear, good to excellent. the sound quality is much improved over using the dongle. works well with verizon vx6800 i\\'ve had the headphones for 4 weeks and couldn\\'t be happier. *the battery life is excellent - i keep them on & paired with my pda phone for about an hour a day. *the headphones are fairly light. even after a long train right, they don\\'t wear me down and are comfortable. nice just what i was looking for and works good. sound is good and has a good range. nice sound nice sound - would have been great if my mobile was capable of syncing to it. they work great, i get good reception even through concrete walls. just okay..... the product is great when it is working properly. cheap, very good fidelity excellent buy. battery charge-life is quite long. fidelity is spectacular (mp3s recorded at 320k - anyone who listens to 128k doesn\\'t care about sound quality). very good for the price good sound quality/price ratio for a stereo bluetooth headphone. excellent for the price i think the sound is great when you consider the price. the range is excellent; i would say anywhere from 30-50 feet! these are the best headphones i ever had. they sound good and are very light weight. bluetooth range is good. decent head set sound quality is decent, gets a little static if you have the phone down in a low pocket close to your body. these headphones are pretty easy to use. the sound quality is very good, i never heard that low level buzz that i had read about and i listen mostly at very low levels. good idea and design i love the idea of not having a cord to tie you down, the only flaws i have found with this is that they\\'re not quite as loud as i would like, and the flashing blue lights are a pain to keep turning off, other then that this is a great pair of headphones with semi-decent sound quality. works as advertised i was able to quickly get these headphones up and running. the connection is generally good while running or walking with the phone on my hip, however, the same location while cycling the music to skip so much that it is not listenable. the headphones are comfortable and the behind the neck design allows me to use them with my bike helmet. awesome deal, great headset!! for the price, this headset is really worth every cent. jabra headset - good sound, a bit heavy pros: i bought these sets after reading good comments from folks. headset is pretty nice and sound quality is great as well. great headphones the sound quality is really good. at this price, you can\\'t ask for a better bluetooth headphone. decent headset for a great price this a great headset that is at a fair price. the conrols are simple to use. not having to deal with wires is great. the headset itself is not heavy. it is comfortable to wear. the battery life is great, i usually leave them on all day (15 hours) and plug them back in when i get home without worries. i\\'d recommend them to anybody who needs a headset but doesn\\'t want to pay an arm and a leg, they\\'re worth the money. perfect i bought this for my motorola q cell phone and it works perfectly. the music through these are awesome. they seem to work pretty well, sound is good. overall, a decent pair of headphones for not a whole lot of money! they were easy to set up and since they are both from the same manufacturer they both use the same charger so i do not have any extra ones to worry about and i always have a spare to take with me when i am gone for long periods of time. nice headphones for the price i got these bluetooth headphones for my daughter but i\\'ve been using them too. the quality of my voice over the mic is awesome too. jabra bt620s great product, works well w/ computer and phone. great quality, easy to set up and use. the sound quality on these earphones are very good. jabra bt620s bluetooth headphone the headset is versatile. the headset works great with my lgcu515. the sound is decent. nice quality, easy to use i find these to be a very good quality headset. the sound is significantly better than two bluetooth headsets i have tried previously. i like the fact that the band around the back of the head is a single piece, which eliminates the weak spots i have found in earlier multiple piece sets which broke within a few months of purchase without any significant trauma. i haven\\'t had any problem with synching, picking up calls, or picking up music without having to explicitly tell the headphones or bluetooth to do so. bluetooth gives you freedom from cords, but quality issues hurt bluetooth is nice. the jabra bt620s allow you pair with two devices and i might add, the pairing process is simple. battery life is excellent. sound quality is adequate and no more. so far so good this is my second bluetooth stereo headset(the previous was a samsung) and i like this one much more. the jabra seems sturdy, i find it comfortable even if i am also wearing glasses. what you need to know let me just say that these headphones work absolutely fine, they have good sound, and are built well enough that if you arent trying to stuff them in your back pocket they should be fine. they sounded as good as any similarly built set of regular headphones. quirky sound quality is excellent, and the fit is fairly comfortable for this type of headset. uneven performance the fit is good and the controls are amongst the best i\\'ve seen on any bluetooth stereo headset. the sound quality is also good. but it is ok, good sound and some what practical. conflict with microware oven frequency but super sound quality excellent sound quality but conflict with my panasonic microware oven frequency. again the sound quality is excellent. this headset will rock your world. must admit it is great! i have to say... this products is actually great. the battery lasts forever, and the sound is pretty good for me. i use this for working out, the the spongy thing gets wet... so i clean it daily with some type of anti bacterial spray (i hate doing it)... other than that everything is great! as a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. on the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren\\'t audiophiles. and the sound quality is passable, but certainly not great. i managed to pick up a set of these bad boys for the sweet price of $59.95 and am absolutely in love with them! they are a good fit for me and are relatively light weight. they have pretty dang good sound quality (the best i have heard) the lights on the side are a nice touch, and light up a circular shape sweet price! great headphones!!! the sound is pretty good, not bulky at all, just perfect. it works flawlessly, the music controls, the phone controls, everything!!! the voice quality is good when i turn it up to highest. lot of bass and it is stereo. it fits my head and it is comfortable enough for 2 hours (as long as i try). works great with best buy\\'s insigna mp3 works great with best buy\\'s insigna mp3. the jabra has the right price, good sound quality (well, it\\'s not a bose but let\\'s face it--if you were in the market for that type of big ticket item, you wouldn\\'t have taken the time to read my review; $30 gets you clear high trebles and some decent bass), and the behind-the-neck design keeps them in place. speaking of the size, incredibly its weight is a non-issue. the controls for both the phone calls and the music play are intuitive and easy to learn/use. also, the bluetooth pairing went through without incident (no wires--definitely a benefit), and the battery life...well, let\\'s just say that my cell phone will run out of battery power before the jabra will. they have pretty good range where i can sit 20 feet away from computer and still listen to my music comfortably. best set of headphones i have ever bought! otherwise these are a solid pair of headphones and the microphone is pretty good. great bluetooth headphone i\\'ve tried a wide variety of bluetooth devices for my cellphone. the microphone offers noise cancelled and \"land line\" quality to other party. i purchased this pair of headphones and have been nothing but impressed and utterly satisfied. the price is $90 less than bestbuy sells it for and it works every bit as well. they are sweat proof, i have a tendency to work out with a vigorous intensity and i perspire quite a bit, these hold up nicely. the fit and finish, the quality of the product and the sound quality are far and away superior to the motorolla set which i had to return 3 times. great headphone but not as comfortable nice headphone, answer cell phone and voice dialing, all basic function as described with no problem, easy to operate ! sound qulity is good, bass is a little stronger than listen from pc or from pc speakers directly ! the earpieces are fairly comfortable, i actually like the large size rather than the earbud style of headphone, my ears do not get sore as fast. as far as for handsfree phone calls: sound quality is great. there is a little echo while transmitting my voice, doesn\\'t seem to bother the caller on the other end, i don\\'t mind because i don\\'t have to hold my phone to my head, good trade off. if you are familiar with bluetooth, i was not, you shouldn\\'t have any problems, tech support via e-mail was very good and fairly quick. the sound is the most important part and the sound is simply amazing! oh, and if you are a ps3 fan, these headphones are awesome to use. while not quite up to the level of my high-end (wired) sennheiser hd 595s, they deliver excellent sound and freedom of mobility which should more that satisfy most listeners. good value for the money i was looking for a relatively inexpensive bluetooth stereo headphone to go with my samsung juke. this unit has excellent value and the sound is very good. i like the comfort of the unit. easily worth the price the bt620s is a fine little gadget. it works well, sounds great, is easy to use and compatible with my bluetooth devices. the actual flexing plastic part seems fairly durable, so i\\'m not worried about breakage. so for $40, this is a fantastic deal for something that i imagine works just as well as the more expensive competitors and has a comparable comfort level. the weight of the device is not too much. great sound! these are beyond a doubt the best sounding wireless headphones i\\'ve ever heard. i have a stereo 2.0 bluetooth adapter for my ipod and these headphones sound as good as a pair of $50 wired sony\\'s i have, i wear them at work and can easily get 30 feet away in a factory floor enviroment. call quality is exceptional on my end, others can tell i\\'m on a wireless headset but typically have no problem understanding me if i\\'m not standing outside in the wind. battery life is almost unbelievable. other then an uncomfortable fit with my glass\\'s, these headphones are the perfect addition to a bluetooth setup. great combination headphone for mp3 player and lg vx8300 cell great combination. i am thrilled with the being able to work, answer my cell without switching headphones. i especially like the fact that i can connect to the mp3 player and the cell at the same time. i like the play time (up to 16 hrs) says jabra. good headphones for good price. the convenience offered by these headphones is great. sound quality is good, and it allows you to turn off the annoying flashing blue lights that make you look like a techno buoy. the calls sound great and testing it with someone else proves the voice comes in clear. battery life is great (12 + hours with a 2 hour charge). great bluetooth headphones, poor fit these headphones are great in every aspect except for comfort. the built-in mic works surprisingly well, for a really hassle-free bluetooth experience. one of the best bluetooth stereo headsets out there...a 4.5 actually pros: sounds amazing performs perfectly nice design comfortable cons: a little too big switch gets pressed unintentionally i got these for the sole reason for taking it to the gym. i do not like cords slowing me down or getting snagged on gym equipment and this headset is perfect for the job. it plays music in stereo and the sound is amazing. first, it\\'s big. the neckband is comfortable though a little flimsy. overall it\\'s a good product - range is good, and the sound is amazing. good range. very nice headphones. i am almost an audiophile and these headphones are good enough for me. the bass levels are pretty good and all the rest of the frequency distribution is balanced. the headphones fit quite comfortably. the headphones never have any trouble even in that environment. excellent for music as well as talking on the phone i got these, at considerably greater expense than here i might add, from my cell phone vendor. they are light and comfortable and in summary, it is good being able to listen to music on your phone without the hassle of wires or of having to reach for a player to skip songs you don\\'t like but the experience, in terms of music quality, is way short of that when using an ipod and high-end headphones.'"
